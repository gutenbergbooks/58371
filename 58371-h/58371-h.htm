<h2>PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The friendly welcome accorded by
the English Public to my “Chinese
Painted by Themselves” has encouraged
me to publish this translation of
my last work.</p>

<p>Old Epicurus summed up his philosophy in
pleasures well understood. The peoples of
the world, all epicureans in a certain measure,
amused themselves before him, and have
amused themselves since, each after his own
fashion.</p>

<p>I do not think I shall displease the people
of the Country often called “Merry England”
in bringing to their notice “The Chinaman
at Home.”</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTORY</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Our pleasures are not such as to
shock modesty; they are simple
and honest, as becomes an ancient
nation, which has left the age of youthful
follies long behind it, has due self-respect,
and knows how to amuse itself decently.</p>

<p>In my book, “Chinese Tales,” I endeavoured
to show the minor details of the life
of my compatriots, whose political and social
customs I have described in my other book,
“The Chinese Painted by Themselves.”
The object of this new book is to give a
picture of our private amusements and of our
small public fêtes. It belongs, accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
to anthropological literature, describing as it
does a series of ethnological phenomena,
games, ceremonies, and fêtes, which, however
much they may resemble those to be seen
in all other countries, have, nevertheless, a
special character in each country. This
character depends largely on the national
conceptions of the people under consideration.</p>

<p>Everybody amuses himself as he thinks
best. This affirmation is as true for nations
as it is for individuals. Our joys and our ways
of manifesting them are they not the expression
of our individuality? And when a whole
people rejoices in a certain manner, does not
that mean that it offers in its fêtes a kind
of picture of its inner life, a synthesis of its
dearest aspirations and desires? Our pleasures
are determined by our moral and philosophical,
political, and social views. Religion
has much also to do in fashioning them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
according to her likeness. The character of
a nation is never better shown than in its
enjoyments—its fêtes; in one word, in its
pleasures. Tell me how you amuse yourself,
and I will tell you what you are.</p>

<p>In the task I have laid upon myself of
revealing the Asiatic East to the European
West, it seems to me that this new chapter
will not be out of place. In any case, the
author will be sufficiently rewarded if the
reader—albeit only for a moment—finds some
pleasure in turning over the leaves of the
book he has written.</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">I remember reading in Mr.
Paleologue’s clever book, “L’Art
Chinois,” the statement “that
China never had but one single style of
architecture, throughout all the periods of
its history, for her public and private,
civic, or ecclesiastical buildings.”</p>

<p>Now, a close observer will notice in
our buildings a great variety of styles, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
fineness of which naturally is lost upon those
who do not take the trouble to examine
them carefully. It is just like a passer-by
looking at some of the new streets in Paris,
where all the houses are built by one and the
same building company, and resemble one
another externally; or at the grand avenues
in New York City, or the long <i lang="de">strassen</i> in
Karlsruhe, spread out round a central square
in the shape of a fan. At first sight one
cannot help the exclamation that these
buildings produce a desperately monotonous
impression.</p>

<p>But should you pay the architect a visit
and examine the plans of these various
constructions, you cannot fail to notice that
not one interior resembles another. The
difference is as slight as the physiognomies
of different people, who have the same
features but have different faces.</p>

<p>It is true that long ago there was little
variety in our architectural styles, but in
spite of that it can be asserted that each
of our cities has a special character, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
presents, as far as its buildings are concerned,
distinctive features.</p>

<p>There are many reasons for this want
of variety. In the first place, those foreign
elements, which so often so profoundly
modified European architecture, have been
almost completely wanting in China. Then
it must be remembered that official prescriptions
regulate the style of houses for
different functionaries, a custom which must
necessarily limit architectural originality and
fancy; and then there is tradition, which
is so powerful in our country, and which
did not allow of any modification of the
pure Chinese style, which had been consecrated
by the use of centuries.</p>

<p>Let us now examine the different kinds
of Chinese houses.</p>

<p>In the northern districts, less favoured
by Nature, buildings are generally constructed
of earth. It is only the palaces
and the houses of rich people of which
the framework is of wood. In spite of the
severity of the climate and the quantities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of dust which are brought by the wind
from the sandy regions, these houses have,
generally speaking, two stories, in which
they differ considerably from the houses
in the south, which have rarely more than
one. The walls are low, with but a very
slight curve at the top, whereas in the
south this curve, which we style “the
saddle,” is very pronounced. These walls
are called “fire-walls,” because they are
intended to protect the house against fire.</p>

<p>The upper storey is called “the pavilion of
the horse races,” a name I have never been
able to account for, as the staircases were
never such as to allow of horses being
brought up them. This upper storey is generally
used as a place of pleasure, the ground
floor being preferred as an ordinary dwelling-place.
The Chinese love symmetry in
all things, and so, no matter the size of
the ground on which they build, their
houses are always constructed so that the
drawing-room is just opposite the entrance
door, and that on either side of it there be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
one or two rooms exactly the same. Instead
of speaking of our houses as having
so many rooms, we say, “It has such a
number of rooms on the front—three, five,
seven,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following is a description of a good
average middle-class dwelling:</p>

<p>On entering you find yourself in a large
antechamber, flanked on the right and on
the left by a servants’ room. Facing you
are three doors, one large and two small,
giving access to a courtyard, which is
entered by descending a staircase of three
steps. On either side of the courtyard
there is first a paved gallery, then a room.
One of these rooms is reserved for the
children of the house, the other is a
smoking-room, or small drawing-room.</p>

<p>The drawing-room is reached by ascending
the three steps on the other side
of the yard. On its left and right hand
side there are one, two, or three rooms.
Behind the drawing-room is the dining-room,
flanked also on either side with one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
two, or three rooms. Then comes a second
courtyard, with the kitchen and lumber-room
on the right and left. If the house
is a large one, you will find three, five, or
seven more rooms behind this courtyard.
The same distribution may be repeated
over and over again where the habitation
is very vast. The garden, with its kiosques
and its artificial rockeries, is on one of the
wings, and is surrounded with walls.</p>

<p>The rent of an ordinary house, such as
the one that I have just described, is about
two pounds eight shillings a year.</p>

<p>The roof is more or less elevated, but
it always is very sloping, and is covered
with overlapping tiles, so as to allow the
rain to run off easily.</p>

<p>The windows are large, the framework
being of wood. The panes are of glass,
silk, or transparent paper, according to
the part of the country. Instead of endeavouring
to protect themselves against
draughts, the Chinese do all they can to
procure currents of air through the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The interior decoration is generally very
luxurious. The prominent parts of the
wood-work are carved, the flat parts are
varnished. The walls are hidden behind
paintings representing historical scenes; the
wall which fronts the drawing-room is
usually painted with a subject referring to
the rank of the master of the house. On
entering the drawing-room the eye is at
once caught by the sight of a gilt and
carved box, which hangs from the horizontal
rafter under the roof. On either
side of it is a large gilt dragon, who seems
to be guarding it. This box contains the
patents of nobility or commissions of official
rank held by the proprietor.</p>

<p>The paper on which the words “Happiness”
or “Long Life,” which are given to
members of the family by the Emperor
according to their merits, are also hung
up in this place.</p>

<p>The furniture of the drawing-room is
extremely simple. There is a long, large
table in the middle, with eight chairs arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
on the two sides; between each set
of two chairs is a little square tea-table.
Then there are two square stools.</p>

<p>The places of visitors are arranged according
to their rank; the stools are always
reserved for the master of the house.
When the visit is a ceremonious one, or
there is a fête in the family, the chairs,
which are usually of marble or of bamboo,
are covered with embroidered red satin
covers, which is just the contrary of what
is done in Europe, where the furniture is
uncovered for receiving. There are always
a large mirror, a vase of flowers, a plate
of decorative fruits, and a clock on the
drawing-room table. In the centre stands
a scent-burner.</p>

<p>On the walls are rolls of autographs or
paintings from the pens and pencils of
celebrities of style or of art. Very few
nick-nacks are to be seen in our drawing-rooms,
which we make as severe and
simple as we can. Only occasionally does
one see a few nick-nacks in the little drawing-rooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
or in the pleasure kiosk in the
garden. The greater part are hidden away
in cupboards, and are only produced at
the Fête of the Moon, of which I speak
further on, or on certain religious festivals.</p>

<p>We have neither cupboards in the walls,
such as are the delight of Parisian housewives,
nor alcoves in our houses in China.</p>

<p>This is a fair description of a Chinese
home. I do not speak of the dwelling-places
of the poor, which are as sad as
little decorative. Happiness, it has been
said, has no history, but it is wealth that
alone admits of description. Misery is
not to be depicted, unless, as in Theophile
Gautier’s “Capitaine Fracasse,” it is lodged
in an old castle, picturesquely in ruins.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>RELIGIOUS AND NATIONAL FÊTES</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">It is terribly hot, forty degrees in
the shade, and summer has only
just begun. It is the fifth day of
the fifth moon, the date on which the Fête
of the Dragon is celebrated.</p>

<p>The town changes its aspect completely.
This is owing to the numberless red
papers which are stuck on every door,
and on which can be read wishes of
happiness formulated in the most diversified
manner. At the side of these
papers are two bunches of Indian grass,
with the roots tightly tied up with red
strings, nailed to the door. It is a
popular belief that this plant, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
sword-shaped leaves, drives away all evil
spirits.</p>

<p>After having performed the usual sacrifices
before the tablets of our ancestors,
we feast <i lang="fr">en famille</i> on ceremonial
dishes, and drink that wine, tinctured
with orpiment, which, according to a very
general opinion, destroys the germs of
epidemic diseases for the whole ensuing
year.</p>

<p>When noon strikes we hasten to put
bowls of water in the courtyard to catch
the rays of the sun, which is in the centre
of the sky. It is said that the water thus
irradiated renders excellent services to
women in labour.</p>

<p>After breakfast we go to the West Lake
to see the dragon canoe races. These are
very long flat boats, manned by from twenty
to thirty oarsmen. The figure-head is
either a colossal dragon or a prancing horse.
A sailor astride on the animal holds in his
hands a large flag, the movements of which
serve as commands to the helmsman, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
is standing motionless at the stern. Behind
the dragon is an orchestra, which fills
the air with the rolling of drums, mingled
with the thunder of the tam-tams.</p>

<p>The goal is seen far off; sometimes it is
a living duck. When the boat approaches
the bird dives under and tries to escape,
but it is usually caught after a short chase,
and brought up in triumph, struggling and
squealing. More often, however, it is a
large piece of bamboo, to which is fastened
a piece of rich silk stuff, the offering of
some society. The winner keeps this as
his prize.</p>

<p>As soon as the signal has been given the
struggle begins; flags fly, waving now to
the left, now to the right, indicating the
way to be followed to the human statue,
who, seated at the helm, guides the effort
of the sailors. Urged on by the numerous
oars, the canoes glide rapidly over the
water, like gigantic centipedes, amidst the
cries of the spectators, crowding together
on the banks, or on the decks and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
cabins of the pleasure-junks anchored along
the river side.</p>

<p>Then may be seen the fluttering of a
thousand fans, beating in unison with the
hearts of the spectators. The waves,
driven up by the canoes running to the
banks, bury, for the moment, the lotus
flowers and water-lilies, which soon, however,
reappear fresher and more pure for
their short immersion; the broad leaves
of the nenuphar rising up again, bring with
them some of the water of the river, and
let it fall off again in cascades of glittering
pearls. Now they are again immersed,
once more to rise; in a continual coming
and going, which lasts for many hours.</p>

<p>This is the Chinese nautical Grand Prix,
and the aspect of the lake is really fairy-like.
Imagine the boxes at the Grand
Opera in Paris, or the grand stand at
Longchamps, placed on floating flower
barges in the middle of a river, with
panes of glass of every colour; add to
this picture ladies in grand toilettes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
men with radiant faces, and you will have
a fairly accurate idea of this very popular
fête.</p>

<p>After the races the foot-passengers disperse
and the people disembark from the
junks. The sun not having yet set, everybody
uses the rest of the afternoon in
taking a little rest, or in enjoying the
fresh air of the country. Some go to the
monastery near the lake, others repose
under the great trees which are round an
old tomb.</p>

<p>The latter is the burying-place of an
ancient and celebrated man of letters of
the town, who, during his lifetime, had
his last abode constructed in an admirable
site on the banks of the water. Instead
of the usual inscriptions which celebrate
the virtues of the deceased, the man of
letters caused to be graven on the stones
of his tomb his own poems and those of
his friends.</p>

<p>Here are two of the best-known lines
of his:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Behind the carpet of the cornflowers and under the shade of the pine trees,</div>
<div class="verse">I shall receive throughout all time the perfume of the incense which my children will bring to me in offering.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I went with some friends to the monastery,
where we were received in the most hospitable
fashion. The Buddhist priests offered
us first of all a cup of delicious tea, and
afterwards invited us to dine with them.
It was a dinner without meat—for the
Buddhist priests do not eat meat—but an
excellent dinner for all that. First of all
because it was a change from what we were
accustomed to, and then because, in spite
of the fact that no meat is used, the cuisine
of these priests fully deserves its reputation
of exquisite delicacy. They prayed us to
come again in a month to taste the Lichi
fruits, for, said they, their garden possessed
eighteen trees of the best kind, which they
called “the eighteen young ladies.”</p>

<p>To depict to you the picturesque situation
of this monastery, it will be sufficient for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
me to quote a passage from a celebrated
poem, which is engraved on a rock behind
the altar to Buddha:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Whilst the sound of the bells draws itself out and seems to be lost in the green mist of the twilight,</div>
<div class="verse">The dreaming poet walks all alone amongst the ten thousand trees.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As it is getting late, we have made up
our minds to sleep at the monastery.</p>

<p>I may as well mention here that in
China the monasteries are a kind of hotel.
There is always a large number of rooms
set aside for the reception of visitors. We
took advantage of this, because at night-fall
the gates of the city are locked, and
accordingly we were locked out. We had
no reason to regret this, because in the
evening we were able to be present at the
religious service of the Buddhists, and could
convince ourselves that once they have
finished with their religious duties these
monks are quite ordinary mortals, very gay,
fond of laughter and amusement. We made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
verses together, as we sat drinking rice-wine,
and we all came to the conclusion
that these priests have nothing in
common with their Puritan colleagues in
Europe.</p>

<p>In our conversation, as well as in the
poems we composed, not an allusion was
made to religious or even philosophical subjects.
Nothing was written or spoken about
but the moon, flowers, and the beauties
of Nature. These good people understood
that there is nothing more detestable than
“to talk shop.”</p>

<p>One of my friends asked one of these
priests how he could live without any family,
the Buddhist priests not being allowed to
marry. The priest answered him in verse,
saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I do not wish the mud to soil the leaves of the lotus.</div>
<div class="verse">I have a very sharp knife to cut the threads of the nenuphar with.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In short, they were all very gay, and our
conversation lasted after this fashion until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
break of day. A most harmless and <i lang="fr">comme
il faut</i> debauch.</p>

<p>And that evening, seated on his lotus-flower,
with his bald head and his stereotyped
smile, Buddha did not sulk.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE FÊTE OF THE MOON</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">This fête is celebrated in the eighth
month of the year. It lasts six
days, beginning on the 10th and
ending on the 15th, with the full moon. It
is thought that on that night the moon
is larger than at any other time in the
year.</p>

<p>This fête is made the occasion of all
kinds of amusements, and specially it is
kept by sending to one’s friends all sorts
of presents in the shape of the moon, as
also by the exhibition of nick-nacks.</p>

<p>One buys a quantity of little statues, representing
genii, immortals, Buddhas. All
these celestials are arranged on the landings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
amongst the objects collected by the
family, treasures which, imprisoned all the
year round, are only produced on this
solemn occasion. The centre of the exhibition
is always filled by a large pagoda,
which is illuminated, like the house itself,
at every window.</p>

<p>Outside, fireworks are let off and crackers
exploded. Indoors, music is played to
cheer the reunion of friends and of the
family. Mutual invitations are issued to
come and admire the richness and the
good taste of the different collections.</p>

<p>At midnight, on the 15th, everybody sits
down in the courtyard to a great banquet,
with which the fête is terminated. This
banquet is specially given to await the
descent of the goddess of the moon. The
myth will have it, that on that day she
leaves her celestial abode to come down
and listen to the wishes of the mortals.
Needless to say, that nobody ever yet saw
the graceful inhabitant of our satellite; but
it is difficult to drive out of the people’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
minds traditions which have been handed
down for centuries from father to son.</p>

<p>A story is, however, told of an old
woman who was favoured one night with
a visit from the Chinese Diana, who asked
her what she wanted, and who promised
to grant all that she could wish for.
Dazzled by the splendour of the costume
and the imposing beauty of the lady, the
old woman stood speechless, and could
not say a word. At last, encouraged by
the kindly insistence of the queen of the
moon, the old woman summoned up enough
courage to carry her hand to her mouth,
meaning thereby that she only wished to
have enough to eat for the rest of her
life.</p>

<p>The apparition made a sign of acquiescence,
and remounted to heaven. The next
morning the old woman was seen wearing
a gigantic, full beard. The goddess had
not understood her gesture.</p>

<p>The moon is the patroness of poetry.
Autumn, moreover, the most beautiful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
seasons, with its wealth of chrysanthemums
and oleas of sweet perfume in flower, furnishes
also subjects dear to the poets.
This fête is accordingly more aristocratic
and more literary than the others, which
have little to offer but popular pleasures.
Thus, to celebrate it, pretence is made of
transforming the terrestrial abodes into so
many crystal palaces to harmonise with
the splendours which are believed to exist
in the celestial regions.</p>

<p>I have said that the moon is the patroness
of poetry. It is she, indeed, who, from the
earliest ages, has at all times known how
to inspire poets—now with sad, now with
joyous songs. It is she who unites in
common contemplation the looks and the
thoughts of lovers separated by long distances
from each other; it is she who
consoles the unhappy despairing in their
solitudes. The most intimate secrets of
the heart are confided to her, the softest
and sweetest wishes are formed before her
transparent mirror. Who shall then be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
astonished if poetry cherish this kindly
queen of the night?</p>

<p>Here are some verses dedicated to this
star by our poets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Raising my glass to drink with the moon,</div>
<div class="verse">I notice that we are three—</div>
<div class="verse">The moon, my shadow, and myself.</div>
<div class="verse">The moonlight comes right up to my bed,</div>
<div class="verse">Covering the floor with a dazzling surface,</div>
<div class="verse">Which at first sight I take for ice;</div>
<div class="verse">Then, noticing that it is the moon,</div>
<div class="verse">I fall to thinking of my native land.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The number of legends attaching to the
moon is so large that it is impossible to
relate them all. Some say that the goddess
who inhabits the lunar palace is still unwedded.
Others maintain that she is a
tearful widow. The most original of these
legends tells us that the goddess is the
wife of a celebrated archer, of the reign of
Han, named Haou-I. He had already shot
down nine suns with his terrible bow, and
was just going to fire at the tenth—the
only one that remains to us—when the sun-god
said to him, “Give me grace of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
one, which I need for the light of the
world. In return I will give you a magic
draught which will give you the power to
go and to dwell in the sun itself.” At the
same time he told the archer the day and
the hour on which he was to take the enchanted
potion.</p>

<p>Haou-I committed the imprudence of
confiding his secret to his wife, who, not
willing to believe the truth of what he said,
tried the draught forthwith. Immediately
she grew light as a bird and flew away to
the moon.</p>

<p>Is this not like reading Jules Verne, perfected,
in the second century, for it is from
that century that this legend dates.</p>

<p>Here is another myth, the translation of
the poem of which I have given elsewhere.
I consider it very graceful. It tells that
Emperor Ming-Houang, of the Thang dynasty,
had travelled in a dream to the
moon. It was there that he learned a
melody entitled “Dress of Rainbow and
of Feathers.” This air was the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
an insurrection, which nearly upset his
throne. One of his officers, in love with
a favourite who sang this celestial melody
in perfection, revolted, and the Emperor
could only preserve his throne by sacrificing
the life of his favourite. So true it is
that always and in all things one must
seek the woman, even in the moon.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>THE FEAST OF LANTERNS</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Feast of Lanterns comes almost
directly after that of the New Year.
It may almost be said that one is
the complement of the other, as the latter in
date takes place from the tenth day to the
fifteenth day of the first moon, and as the
holidays of the New Year are prolonged
from the twentieth day of the twelfth
moon of the dying year to the twentieth
day of the first moon of the new year.</p>

<p>During this month of holiday, all official
business is suspended. The seals which
represent the official signatures are locked
up in their cases.</p>

<p>It is the use made, in incredible quantities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of all sorts of lanterns that gives its name
and its originality to this feast. The Chinese
are very fond of making these lanterns,
and give them a luxury of form, and employ
in their manufacture a variety of
material which defy imagination. There
is not on that day a single nook of the
mighty Empire which is not thus lighted
up. To carry out an illumination on such a
scale, it will be readily understood that something
more is needed than is seen elsewhere
when lanterns are used for illuminations.</p>

<p>To get a more exact idea of the character
of our illuminations, imagine one of your
large toy-shops filled with transparent
lanterns—horses, lions, sheep, elephants,
soldiers, horsemen, parasols, flowers, grotesque
figures, fantastic animals, &amp;c. All
the imitations of living things are associated
with all the varieties of fancy to
transform light silk or translucid paper into
multi-coloured lanterns, now simple, now
double. These latter turn round and round,
driven by the motion of the heated air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and display the series of pictures with
which they are filled. There is not a
thing in nature, or out of it, that does
not on that day take shape of lantern.</p>

<p>A gigantic lantern representing a dragon
is carried about in the public places to
the sound of music. This is composed
of a framework of wicker covered with
transparent stuff, on which the dragon’s
scales are painted. It is mounted on
staves, which are held by the bearers.
Anybody can get the procession to stop
before his house, or he can have it enter
his courtyard if he wants a private representation.
In this case, all he has to do
is to let off a certain number of crackers
as the procession passes his house, so as
to let the bearers know that they have to
stop. After the performance, which consists
in making the dragon fly about in
every direction, cake and wine are offered
to the musicians and to the bearers, but
never money, for the procession is always
composed of people belonging to the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
classes of society, who do this for their
pleasure. The European torchlight procession
gives but a very feeble idea of our
dragon walk.</p>

<p>When a marriage takes place in a family,
the relations of the bride send her on her
wedding-day a lantern representing a divinity
holding a child in his hand. If in the second
year the wife has not had a child, another
lantern is sent her representing an orange;
the word orange in Chinese is synonymous
to the words “make haste.” The lantern
thus constitutes a kind of punning reminder
to her of her duty. Lanterns are also sent
from the local temples to any house in the
parish in which either a recent marriage,
or a birth, or a literary success has taken
place.</p>

<p>The subjects of these lanterns differ according
to circumstances; the bearers are always
accompanied by an orchestra. One sees a
large lantern, on which are written enigmas,
riddles, and puzzles, in almost every street.
The passers-by are supposed to try their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
skill at guessing these puzzles, and those who
succeed get as a reward some letter-paper,
or some brushes, ink, fireworks, sweets, &amp;c.
When the problem propounded is some
clever <i lang="fr">jeu de mots</i>, or a comic answer is
given, you can hear the whole street ringing
with shouts of healthy laughter.</p>

<p>Formerly under the dynasty of the Hans,
it was forbidden to be out in the streets of
nights except during these feasts. On
these occasions the bridge gates of the
city remained wide open, and the padlocks
of the bridge railings were unlocked all
night.</p>

<p>Poetry has celebrated these nights of
popular gaiety:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The trees on fire and the flowers in silver form bouquets on every side,</div>
<div class="verse">And the iron padlocks no longer exist on the starlit bridges.</div>
<div class="verse">A fine dust pursues on all the roads the perfumed feet of the horses;</div>
<div class="verse">And the moon shining brilliantly, accompanies the walkers;</div>
<div class="verse">These for the most part belong to the radiant youth,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Who sing so joyously that one fancies one hears the celebrated melody of Lo-Mei-Hoa, or the fall of the petals of the plum-tree.</div>
<div class="verse">This night it is not forbidden to walk abroad,</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore let the waters flow slowly and without undue haste.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another poem says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Two phœnixes come down from heaven with their triumphal chariot.</div>
<div class="verse">Six dragons rise from the bottom of the sea bearing a mountain on their backs.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Does not this remind you of the “Isoline”
of Catulle Mendes?</p>

<p>Let me quote a few more lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What charitable hand has scattered all these lotus seeds,</div>
<div class="verse">Which at one and the same time flower in every corner of the city?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All this literature will show what a brilliant
fête it is.</p>

<p>There are, of course, besides, family
meetings, parties, where wine and poetry
help to bring the solemnity to its end
indoors; while, in the streets, the pleasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of the joyous crowd are prolonged until
the morning.</p>

<p>Lanterns have this advantage over gas
and electricity, that they give a softer light
and present more of that variety and irregularity
with which life loves to surround
itself, so as to escape as much as possible
from the monotony and uniformity of ordinary
existence. They lend themselves more
readily to poetry, and realise in a small way
what large illuminations do in a greater.</p>

<p>The members of the constituted bodies
also take part in the illuminations. When
officials go out at night, they are always
accompanied by lanterns, on which are
written in red the name and titles of the
dignitary. On the evening of the feast,
these lanterns decorate the house of the
functionary, like so many visiting cards,
welcoming the public.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let it be said that the little
folk, without whom there is no real pleasure,
have also their rôles to play and their part
to take in the general gaiety. Fruits are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
cut up for them, especially oranges, and the
children light these up with a little candle,
and carry their make-shift lanterns round
the streets. Some of these fruit-lanterns
are wonderfully and beautifully carved and
decorated.</p>

<p>Everything, in one word, is lighted up;
so that could one take on that night a
bird’s-eye view of China from the car of
some balloon, she would show like a sky
starred with thousands and millions of lanterns,
and the dazzled aeronaut would be
forced to admit, as he looked down on the
last day of the feast of the New Year, that
in China, at least, we never have a gloomy
New Year’s Day.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE FEAST OF THE TWO STARS</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The two stars, called Niou-Lang, the
Shepherd, and Tsi-Nu, the Weaver,
are situated, the first on the eastern
shore of the Milky Way—the Tien-Ho, as
we call it, or River of Heaven—and the
other on the western shore. According to
ancient astronomical observations they only
meet once a year, and this meeting is supposed
to take place in the night of the
seventh day of the seventh moon.</p>

<p>Legend pretends that the Shepherd was
married to the Weaving Woman, and that to
punish them for some fault committed in the
celestial regions—a fault analogous to that of
Adam and Eve—the sovereign of the skies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
separated them eternally. Once only in the
year did he allow them to see each other for
an instant by crossing the stream of water
which, during the rest of the year, put an
insurmountable barrier between their loves.
On that day the magpies, carrying straw in
their beaks, go and build a bridge over the
river, which enables the lovers to cross over
dry-footed. I will add that on that day the
magpies moult. A quantity of other legends
naturally have been grafted on to this one.
Thus it is said that the rain which falls on
the eve of this feast cleans the chariot of
heaven; whilst if it rains on the day itself,
it is said that that is the tears of joy of
the two lovers; if on the morrow, it is their
tears of sorrow at their fresh separation.
The feasts celebrated on this occasion vary
slightly according to the locality. The
object of some of the celebrations is to beg
of the Weaving Woman for skill at the loom;
others take advantage of the fact that on the
day of their reunion the two stars are more
friendly disposed, and implore their pity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>A table is usually spread on these occasions
on the balcony of the pavilion, and laid
with fruits, flowers, wine, candles, and incense.
Low prayers are whispered. Those who
pray are young women whose husbands are
absent. Those who wish to become skilful
workwomen close a spider up in a box.
When they open the box on the morrow
they can tell from the appearance of the
web, which the spider has spun in the
meanwhile, whether the Weaving Woman
has heard their prayers or not. If the web
is neat and regular they may hope for skill
also.</p>

<p>Formerly, under the reign of the Thangs,
this anniversary was celebrated with considerable
splendour in the palace of the
Emperor. It is said that towers about 1000
feet in height—about that of the Eiffel Tower—were
constructed of silk for the occasion,
and that on these towers the favourites of
the Emperor made music and song in
honour of celestial loves. Girls vied with
one another who should soonest thread, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the light of the moon, needles with nine
eyelets, and the winner was proclaimed the
most skilful of all.</p>

<p>A poem says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“It is easier to thread needles by moonlight than to hold a thread straight while the wind is blowing.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There has been very much poetry written
about this feast. Some of the poems are in
praise of the skill of the Weaving Woman;
others lament her too ephemeral happiness;
but the most numerous are those in which
the luckless in love envy the lot of the
lovers untied in heaven, and pray them to
favour them, so that they also may have a
time of meeting, however short. The most
celebrated of these poems is one written by
a sceptical philosopher, who says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“They are immortals, and yet they fear the water.</div>
<div class="verse">I am inclined to doubt that they are very skilful people.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In short, this feast is liked chiefly as a
pleasant holiday, and as affording a theme
for the poets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>In the seventh moon the great heats have
passed away, and advantage is taken of the
soft zephyr and the purity of the sky, which
is generally to be noticed at this season of
the year, to sit out on the balcony of the
house, and to enjoy the cool air whilst
drinking rice-wine. The hypothesis of these
two invisible beings inhabiting the two stars
is rather a pretext than a belief, I am inclined
to think. Long separations, always
so sad, and the meeting again, which is all
the more delightful because it is so unfrequent,
are symbolised in this legend.
The two stars meeting across the Milky
Way in a clear sky, under the burning and
envious gaze of the other stars, and the light
of the crescent-moon, form a graceful picture,
which, by a pretty celestial dream, charms
our spirit, greedy as it always is of the ideal,
and glad to escape for a while from the
truer but often more disappointing images
of worldly realities.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE FEAST OF FLOWERS</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">This feast falls on the fifteenth day
of the second moon, but is, in
practice, prolonged until the end
of spring. It is also called “the feast of
mild warmth.” This is the best season
of the year, the mildest and the most
charming. The trees, almost all in bloom
at that time, alternating with the weeping
willows, drooping down their long
branches laden with green leaves, form,
together with the picturesque pavilions, perspectives
which over and over again have
inspired the poet’s song. There is not a
private garden in the land which is not
then transformed into a horticultural exhibition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Poles of different colours are set
up, ornamented with flags and laden with
little bells, and in the middle all sorts of
games are played, amongst others the game
of butterflies. This game is unknown in
Europe, and, therefore, merits a description
here. Butterflies are caught, and a hair is
attached to them; this hair is weighted
with a scrap of paper, to prevent them
from flying away out of reach, and then
they are pursued by the women armed with
their fans.</p>

<p>Other families go out into the country
to pick flowers, to run in the fields, and to
play the game we call the “lawn game.”
We have had emperors who were poets, and
who, on that day, used to distribute verses
composed by them on different kinds of
plants. It was on this occasion that the
Minister of Agriculture used to present to
the Sovereign seeds of every plant under
cultivation in his empire. In private houses,
this is the day chosen for making rice-wine.
The people of Su-Tcheang march out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
this day in solemn procession, to the sound
of music, to the rice-fields, amidst crowds
of spectators. This fête used to be very
brilliant under the dynasty of the Thangs,
emperors who delighted in simple pleasures
in the midst of flowers. One of them used
to give his favourites pieces of silk, having
the colours of the spring flowers, on this
feast. The silks were afterwards made into
light spring dresses.</p>

<p>One year, when the feast fell in the midst
of late winter weather, the Emperor had a
glass house constructed, and had all the
plants brought in to develop in the heat,
and to the sound of the drum. This is
the origin of glass houses.</p>

<p>One of our novelists relates that one of
the favourites of the Emperor fell in love
with a young man of letters who lived in
the capital, and whose garden was traversed
by a brook which flowed out of
the imperial park. The young woman
being shut up in the palace, jealously
watched, had no means of corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
with him whom she loved. But love will
always suggest ways and means, and it
came to her to write a poem on the petal
of a peony and to confide it to the stream.
The young man of letters was lucky enough
to find the peony-petal, and thus learned
that in spite of the separation he was still
loved. This feeling gave him so much
courage that he set to work with great
diligence and an extraordinary ardour, so
that he was soon able to pass all his examinations,
and to become a celebrated
statesman. In reward of numerous services,
he asked the Emperor to accord him the
hand of the young woman, a request which
his sovereign was unable to refuse. Thus
a simple flower gave a great minister to
the empire, and united two beings who
thought themselves for ever separated.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>NEW YEAR’S DAY</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">This is the Feast of the Three
Beginnings—that of the year, the
months, and the days.</p>

<p>From break of day, which is saluted in
every house with formidable detonations of
crackers, all the functionaries of the capital
betake themselves to the Imperial Temple
to present their respective congratulations
to the Sovereign in person before the
tablet which bears the name of His Majesty.
This duty accomplished, they present their
homages in order to the temples of Heaven,
of Confucius, of the God of Literature, and
of the God of War. After this they pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
calls to each other, an exchange of courtesies
which lasts for four or five days.</p>

<p>On entering a relation’s house, it is the
rule, first of all, to salute the tablets which
represent the ancestors. If the visitors are
newly married, besides tea and cakes, a
bag of oranges and water-melon seeds is
offered to them. Both these signify that
it is hoped they may be blessed with a
large family.</p>

<p>Parties are given every day in turn at
the different houses of friends, and these
are made the occasion for games of every
description. At the same time presents
are distributed amongst the servants of
one’s friends and relations, whilst to the
children of one’s acquaintance one gives
ingots of silver or pieces of silver coin
wrapped up in red paper, or coins threaded
on red strings, which are called lucky coins.
I may mention here, since I am speaking
about children, a striking peculiarity, which
is specially noticeable in the case of very
young children; that is, that in China we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
don’t count people’s ages by the number
of their days, but from year to year. Thus
a child born on the 31st of December is two
years on the evening of the next day, that
is, on January 1st of the following year.</p>

<p>The fourth day of the first moon is the
Feast of the God of Wealth and of Happiness.
All the drawing-rooms are then
lighted up in honour of these divinities,
which are represented either by images or
by a simple piece of writing on paper.</p>

<p>The seventh day is consecrated to the
Feast of Man, and the ninth to that of
God, and so on; for the feasts almost daily
follow in quick succession up to the end
of the Feast of Lanterns.</p>

<p>During this time all that the people
think about is to organise pleasures, and to
give themselves up to enjoyment. Debts
have all been paid off at the end of the
old year, and the public and private holiday,
which is general, gives all the liberty
needed. The season of the year is not
favourable to travelling, and so all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
remains for pastimes are the indoor games
which are best adapted for killing time.
There is a great deal of playing in China
at the time of year under consideration.
Games are played with cards, with dominoes,
with dice, and with the twelve beasts.
There is also a more instructive game,
which represents the steps of official promotion.
I need hardly say that music is
not wanting at these fêtes.</p>

<p>Many families do not eat meat on New
Year’s Day. According to Lie-Tseu, this
custom originated as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘The people of Han-Tang,’ says this author,
‘had offered a pigeon as a New Year’s gift to a
certain philosopher. He accepted the present, and
giving wing to the bird, said, “All things should
live happily on this day.”’”</p>

</div>

<p>This is a pretty tale with a delicate sentiment.
Superstition is not, however, wanting.
With regard to the crackers which one
might suppose are only let off for fun, or in
invitation to noisy revelry, it appears that a
good many people fancy that they serve to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
frighten off evil spirits, who would never
dare to knock at doors behind which such
terrible explosions are taking place.</p>

<p>But there is more than this. Many
people paint a charm on their doors, or
draw a cock, or two guardians, which are
thought to be capable of swallowing whole
any demon who might take it into his head
to show himself.</p>

<p>The astronomical works published under
the dynasty of the Han family state that one
can judge from the wind that is blowing at
daybreak on New Year’s Day what kind of
weather one is going to have throughout
the ensuing year. Thus a south wind
means general dryness, a south-westerly
wind partial drought, and so on. An
easterly wind on New Year’s Day morning
means war, a north-westerly wind a good
harvest, a north wind a moderate harvest.
A north-easterly wind indicates a peaceful
year, wind from the west warns one of
coming floods, and from south-east of
epidemics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same way, the first word that one
writes on New Year’s Day gives its character
to the whole year, good or bad. So, to
make sure, people always begin their letters
on that day with such words as, Happiness,
Wealth, Felicity, Long-Life, and so on.</p>

<p>This manner of ensuring a happy New
Year has inspired a woman philosopher with
the four following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Everybody to-day dips the brush into ink,</div>
<div class="verse">To write the words Happiness, Wealth, Felicity.</div>
<div class="verse">If I might give wise advice to the ambitious,</div>
<div class="verse">It is to bear the life that is laid upon us, and not to ask for things which Providence cannot possibly accord to all.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I may add, that in spite of this excellent
advice everybody continues to ask for what
is unobtainable—the pauper for a little
wealth, the rich man for more than he can
have.</p>

<p>Fables which take something from superstition
know how to mingle with it a certain
amount of wisdom. I will give in proof the
following story:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A poor man of letters, who had not the wherewithal
to celebrate the change of the year, was fast
asleep. In China, as elsewhere, it is true that he
who sleeps dines. In the cottage where he lived
there was neither fire, nor food, nor wine, nor light,
nor pleasure in any form.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile his neighbours were celebrating the
feast with joyous revelry; the feast that was so sad
for the solitary man that we are speaking about.</p>

<p>“All of a sudden, at about midnight, somebody
knocked at his door.</p>

<p>“‘Who is there?’ asked the man of letters, disagreeably
wakened just at the moment when he
was dreaming about victuals, drink, and luxurious
apartments.</p>

<p>“‘It’s I, the God of Wealth.’</p>

<p>“‘I am sorry to say that I cannot receive you.’</p>

<p>“‘And why so?’</p>

<p>“‘Because I have no luck.’</p>

<p>“In spite of the insisting of the God of Wealth,
the poor man absolutely refused to open the door.</p>

<p>“A few moments later another knock was heard
at the door.</p>

<p>“‘Who are you?’ cried the sleeper, again awakened
from his dreams.</p>

<p>“‘’Tis I, the God of Luck.’</p>

<p>“The man of letters sprang out of bed, and received
the visitor with open arms in the dark cabin.
The excellent god then wrote something with the
tip of his finger on the poor man’s forehead and
then disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“The cottager had hardly time to get back to bed
when the God of Wealth again announced himself.</p>

<p>“This time, he was received in the most cordial
manner, and at once placed in the poor man’s hand
treasures of great value. He then asked the poor
man to tell him why, after having at first refused
to receive him, he now gave him so cordial a reception.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, it’s simple enough. Now I have got luck,
which I hadn’t a short while ago. I knew that you
always follow the God of Luck, and so it was him
that I waited for.’”</p>

</div>

<p>It is evident that this means that without
luck, fortune itself is worth nothing.</p>

<p>The God of Wealth, whose good works we
have just related, is nowhere more fêted than
in the town of Canton. Every evening, after
the shops are closed, candles are lighted and
incense is burned before his altars, which
are fitted in niches on the outside of the
shops. The whole town is illuminated and
perfumed. This is an universal adoration
to which no inhabitant of the Chinese empire
gives himself up more fervently than
the Cantonese, who are the most commercial
of the Chinese. Now, the God of Wealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
is also the God of Commerce, and that is as
it should be, for commerce is money after
all; at least, money is the object of trade
and of traders. Plutus is the complement
of Mercury.</p>

<p>The spring equinox, which we call the
beginning of spring, often falls on the first
days of the new year. Then, there is a
great fête.</p>

<p>A veritable procession is organised in
each town. At the head come the prefects
and sub-prefects, and all the members of
their official staff in gala uniform. Each
holds in his hand a spray of artificial flowers,
representing the peony, the flower of the
spring. They ride in their open sedan-chairs,
escorted with music and soldiers.
By their side are carried tablets, on which
are written their titles and the services they
have rendered.</p>

<p>This is the procession of the spring ox.</p>

<p>Behind the official procession is carried
the gigantic statue of an ox, made of clay,
which is plastered over with papers of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
colours. Each colour stands for some atmospheric
change—fine weather, drought,
change, and so on.</p>

<p>Behind this statue comes the real ox,
all gay with ribbons and rosettes. A
statuette is stuck up on its back, which
represents the coming year. Its dress also
portends the weather that is going to be
prevalent throughout the coming year. If
it has shoes on its feet, that means that
the year will be a dry one; if it has clogs,
that the year will be rainy. A clog on
one foot and a shoe on the other, mean
that the year will be a temperate one.</p>

<p>The whole procession makes its way
towards the temple of the God of Agriculture,
where the sacrifices take place.
The ox is slaughtered and its flesh is distributed
amongst the crowd.</p>

<p>Thus in the extreme East the “spring
ox” is being led in procession at about
the same time that the Parisians are leading
round their Carnival “fat ox.” The
two ceremonies are evidently agricultural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
feasts, such as formerly were celebrated in
Egypt with the ox Apis. Man is the same
everywhere; his customs, languages, and
institutions are different, but those are only
differences of form, the substance is everywhere
the same.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE END OF THE YEAR</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The holidays begin ten days before
the end of the year, so that everybody
may have time to prepare
for this great solemnity. For in China
there are no legal holidays, and busy people
only get a rest during the three great feasts
of the Dragon, the Moon, and the change
of the Year. There are five days holiday
during each of the first two feasts, and thirty
days during the last.</p>

<p>It is on these dates that bills usually fall
due, and when they must be paid.</p>

<p>The last feast that we have spoken
about includes several religious ceremonies.
These consist in offering banquets to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
one of the gods in thanksgiving for the
good things he has accorded during the
year that has passed. On the twenty-fourth
day of the twelfth moon a touching ceremony
is performed in the richest and the
poorest houses alike. It is that of the
adieu addressed to the household god and
the reception given to the new-comer. It
appears that this god only holds his tutelary
office during one year, and has then
to make place for a successor.</p>

<p>The altar of this god is always placed
in the kitchen; candles are lighted before
him every day, and incense is burned. At
night a night-lamp, which is called the fire
of long life, burns before his altar.</p>

<p>On the evening of the twenty-fourth, a
grand dinner, with cakes of the most varied
descriptions, and fruits of every sort, is
spread out before this altar for the guests
to partake of.</p>

<p>After having poured out the wine of
libation and let off the crackers, without
which no fête is complete in China, oats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and corn are thrown on the roof of the
house for the horses of the god to feed
upon, and it is at that moment that he is
supposed to take his departure.</p>

<p>The table is then cleared, and a fresh
repast is laid out before the altar for the
refreshment and welcome of the new-comer.
His name is at once inscribed in the place
of that of his predecessor, or it is the
images of himself and his wife that are
placed in the stead of those of the gods
of the previous year.</p>

<p>This is our Christmas Day, after a
fashion. It is this day that the children
look forward to, in the expectation of fruits
and sweets.</p>

<p>Preserves are made of the dishes that
are left over from these two repasts, and
these sometimes last over the whole of the
first month of the new year. The richer a
family is, the more of these preserves will
it make. Parties and fêtes follow each other
in unbroken succession.</p>

<p>On the last day a large pot of rice is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
put out of doors. The rice is garnished
with cypress leaves, on which imitation
ingots of gold and silver are placed. These
are in paper, which is covered with lettering,
meaning long life, honour, health, happiness,
and so on, cut out in red paper. On
the rice are heaped various kinds of fruit,
symbolic of prosperity.</p>

<p>This rice remains standing on a table
in the open air until midnight. It is called
the “rice of the old year.” At midnight
it is replaced by another pot of rice,
garnished in the same way. This is the
rice of the new year, and it is allowed to
stand in position for two or three days.
A lucky day is then chosen in the calendar,
and on this day the rice is removed and
eaten.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to say that the same
sacrifices take place every day before the
tablets of the ancestors, who are never or
on any occasion forgotten.</p>

<p>Formerly a number of superstitious customs
were observed. According to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
old handbook of hygiene, a man had to
lie down secretly by the side of the family
well on the New Year’s Eve, holding in
his hand a flowering branch of the pepper
tree, and, when midnight struck, to throw
this branch into the well, if the family
wanted to have pure and microbeless water
to drink during the ensuing year.</p>

<p>Under the reign of the dynasty of the
Han family, a procession of one hundred
and twenty children, aged from ten to
twelve years, and dressed in grey clothes
with red hats, used to march through the
streets, each child being armed with a
drum, with the beating of which he was
supposed to drive away all evil spirits.</p>

<p>This procession was much more imposing
under the Shungs in the sixth century.
The military took part in it, dressed in
bright uniforms, and carrying gilt lances
and the banners of the dragon. These
marched at the head of the procession,
all more or less hideously masked. Meanwhile,
out in the country the farmers used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to form a torchlight procession, with torches
stuck in the end of long bamboos, and
went running through all their fields, begging
the gods for a good rice-harvest and
an abundance of silkworms. In some provinces
children used to run about the
streets, saying that they had their stock
of intelligence for sale, and, of course,
found none to buy of them. All these
things have now been done away with.
Only the religious ceremonies, of which I
have spoken above, remain in force to-day,
as well as the vigils for seeing the
new year in. I do not speak of certain
eccentric customs, which only form exceptions
to the general habit. Thus, for instance,
the poets will sometimes place their
works on an altar in their house and make
sacrifices before them. Others melt their
gold and pour it into water, predicting
the future from the curious shapes of the
metal as it cools.</p>

<p>There is a literary piece by Han-Wong-Koung,
an adieu to the God of Wretchedness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
which is very much read in China
during the feast of the end of the year.
It is too long to be quoted here, but can
be read by all with great satisfaction. It
gives excellent advice to the poor, and
teaches them how to fight against the
demon of poverty. Some read it to learn
how to remain happy, others how to console
themselves for their wretchedness and
how to get out of it.</p>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">In China the Taoists alone have religious
processions, which is logical
enough, as it is their custom to
represent their gods in human figures. To
mention only the principal ceremonies, I
may allude to the procession of the god
Tai-Tchang, of the god Tcheng-Houang,
of the gods of epidemic diseases, and the
goddesses who protect women in labour
and little children.</p>

<p>Tai-Tchang is the god of the mountain
of the same name, a function which he
combines with that of seventh high judge
in Hades, which has ten such judges.</p>

<p>The processions of Tai-Tchang take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
place during the third moon. The terrible
figure is brought on the appointed day,
surrounded by an imperial pomp. He deserves
all these splendours, seeing that his
title is that of sovereign of the mountain.</p>

<p>He is preceded by his colleagues, the
other grand judges, his sons and godchildren,
who are all reputed princes of
his family. Each of these divinities has its
special escort, with two large lanterns and
a number of tablets, on which are inscribed
the various titles of the god.</p>

<p>Next come the orchestra and the followers,
all dressed in gala clothes. Some
carry a vase full of flowers, others a smoking
incense-bowl.</p>

<p>Besides these, the procession is followed
by numbers of private individuals, carrying
in their hands reduced models of the various
instruments of torture—handcuffs, chains,
hooks, &amp;c. They hope by this means to
draw down on their devoted heads the
punishments which the god may be intending
to inflict on those dear to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>At Fou-Tcheou young girls also take
part in this manifestation, but in the other
cities women are forbidden to do so.</p>

<p>The procession takes its way to a vast
building situated on the outskirts of the
town, which is called the Prison of the
Ghosts. There is such a prison near
every city. The object of this visit is to
release from their captivity the spiritual
captives, so that during the Feast of the
Dead they may be able to take part in
their family celebrations, and perform the
sacrifices which are expected of children
to their ancestors.</p>

<p>The same procession is repeated on a
smaller scale a few days later. This time
its object is to bring back to their prison the
ghost who had been temporarily released.</p>

<p>All along the way down which the procession
passes, the faithful place before
the door of their houses tables on which
lighted candles and incense are burning,
with flowers and fruits. Everybody comes
out of the house to admire the immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
march past, which is, moreover, a kind of
walking exhibition, as the members of the
different societies which take part in it,
and which all belong to different trades,
carry with them all the new productions
of the year. The crowd covers at least
from two to four kilomètres with its long
moving column; for each god has his subalterns,
and each of these subalterns has
the right to a magnificent escort. Toy
and sweet merchants profit by the occasion
to display their wares in the streets, offering
their goods to the children, who always
take a very large share in festivities of this
sort.</p>

<p>At Fou-Tcheou there is a peculiarity
which is particularly interesting. The feast
lasts two days, and the second day’s ceremony
is an exact repetition of the first.
However, on the second day an excursion
is made out to the suburbs of the town,
where Tai-Tchang’s mother-in-law is supposed
to live, the god being brought as a
respectful son-in-law to pay his respects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to the good lady. Happy god, happy
mother-in-law!</p>

<p>Legend relates that a young peasant-girl,
daughter of a butcher, having witnessed
the procession, went home and
died immediately. During her short agony
she told her parents that the god, only
recently having become a widower, had
noticed her great beauty, and had chosen
her for his wife. She was an only
daughter. Her death threw her family
into despair, and in their rage her parents
set out to revenge themselves on the god
by setting fire to his temple. Tai-Tchang,
however, taking human shape, appeared
to them, and pacified them by saying that
he had married their daughter, and that
he owed her parents all the respect due
from a good son-in-law. As a proof of
this, he gave orders that a procession
should take him every year to the house
where the butcher’s wife, the mother of
his divine companion and queen, lived.
This shows that Tai-Tchang was a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
sensible god, free from all aristocratic prejudices,
and the very type of the cunning
son-in-law, diplomatic enough to be able to
soften down the anger of a mother-in-law, who
in her rage had nearly become an incendiary.</p>

<p>In the summer, similar processions take
place in honour of the gods of the epidemical
diseases. We enjoy in China
the sad privilege of owning five epidemics,
which are local and indigenous. The
figures of these gods, which never vary in
appearance, can be seen in every street, and
in every quarter there is a temple consecrated
to these terrible divinities. The
processions in their honour are, in consequence,
daily occurrences, as each part of
the town performs this ceremony in turn.</p>

<p>Although the procession is less imposing
than the one that follows Tai-Tchang,
it is nevertheless of great richness in the
larger quarters. At the head come the
five gods, each preceded by his subalterns.
Behind them is carried an immense
paper-boat, very skilfully made. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
mounted by the same gods, also in paper,
who are placed in the cabin in the centre,
whilst in another cabin are shut up paper-images
of all the other demons. A man
walks at the side of this boat, carrying on
his shoulder, by means of a water-carrier’s
pole, two buckets filled with débris of
meats and offal of all kinds that are
known to engender disease. These buckets
are called ironically the buckets of happiness.
The procession goes straight to
the sea-shore, or to the banks of the
river. Once there, the buckets are flung
into the water, and the ship and its
passengers are set fire to and burnt. The
epidemics are then supposed to have been
driven right out of the town. Mutual congratulation
and a banquet terminate the
fête. This is doubtless doubly symbolical.
The buckets represent hygienic measures,
the boat and its gods and demons figure
the expulsion of all diseases, carried away
by the river or destroyed by the fire.</p>

<p>Tcheng-Houang is the god of the provinces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
His image may be seen everywhere,
just as in Paris we see on the
Place de la Concorde the statues of the
chief citizens of France. The difference is
that Tcheng-Houang is a real personage,
not merely a personification. His ceremony
is about identical with that of Tai-Tchang,
except for the fact that Tchang-Houang
has only right to the title of Governor.</p>

<p>The procession of the goddesses who
protect women in labour and children usually
takes place at the beginning of the
year. The chair on which the statue is
seated is all covered over with flowers, and
as it is carried round by its bearers all
the childless women of the town come
crowding round imploring the divinity to
give them children. The women take from
the chair the first flower that comes into
their fingers. If it is a red flower, they
may hope to have a daughter; if it is a
white flower, that means that they will have
a boy. At the same time, the would-be
mothers make vows to present the goddess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
with tapestry or clothes, or some decorative
object, should she hear their prayer.</p>

<p>Rich people often invite the goddess into
their houses as she passes their doors.
Fireworks are then let off, and flowers are
added to those on the chair. Then tea and
cakes are handed round to the members of
the procession, and after this the Chinese
Lucina is allowed to resume her peregrinations,
to visit other houses if she be so
disposed. Throughout the month women
crowd into the sanctuary of the goddess in
an unceasing stream, some to fulfil their
vows and bring their votive offerings, and
others to implore, in their turns, the intervention
of the Chinese Genitrix goddess.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>A BUDDHIST SOLEMNITY</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">It is on the eighth day of the fourth
moon—which corresponds to the
month of May of the Gregorian
calendar—that the great ceremony of the
ordination of the Buddhist priests, also called
the Feast of the Bath of Buddha, is performed.</p>

<p>On the eve of this day all the candidates
gather together in the monastery in each
town to prepare themselves for the solemnity
of the morrow. At about eight o’clock
in the evening a bell is rung. The priests
are in their places, each on his knees before
the statue of Buddha. First a prayer is
recited, and then hymns are sung. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
this the chief priest takes down off its lofty
pedestal a little idol—a statuette of Buddha,
places it on a platter of gold or of carved
silver, and pours over it water out of another
platter. During this bath, which lasts for
half-an-hour, the priests are in adoration,
and all the musical instruments are heard.
Then comes a rather lengthy pause. At
midnight the ceremony of consecration
begins. The candidates who, either by vocation
or by sudden impulse, have chosen
this career, have to live two or three years
in one of the monasteries, and after this,
before being qualified to exercise the function
of minister, must submit themselves to
a somewhat painful formality.</p>

<p>The great hall of Buddha is brilliantly
lighted up. On tables placed side by side
are set out the images of the different Buddhist
apostles, and all kinds of religious
emblems. Before each of these statues
there is placed a kind of <i lang="fr">prie-dieu</i> stool,
to which the name of one of the candidates
is attached, and it is on this stool that, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a long hour of meditation, the candidate
kneels down. His head is shaven completely
bald, and on the naked skin are
placed three pieces of tinder soaked in
incense, to which the chief sets light. The
candidate continues praying quietly whilst
the conical-shaped tinder candles on his
head burn out, burning away the skin of
his head withal. This is the reason why
one always sees cicatrices on the heads of
the Buddhist priests. Some have three,
some six, some nine, some even more,
according to the degree of their devotion.</p>

<p>On the morrow another ceremony takes
place, that of the reception of the priests.
The old give welcome to the new.</p>

<p>I relate all this because this sight is one
in which in China a great deal of interest
is taken. It is considered quite a pleasure
to be able to witness it.</p>

<p>When I was a boy of nine years, the chief
of the Buddhists who was to officiate at the
ordination that year being a friend of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
father’s, I asked to be allowed to be present
at the ceremony.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful afternoon. After crossing
fields bordered with high trees, and
where the cry of the crickets could be heard
on every side, we entered into a wood, in
the centre of which stood the monastery.
We were well received by the priests, who
told me that no child of my age had ever
been present at the feast. The scene that
I was to see was one which might turn me
either into a fanatical Buddhist, or a bitter
enemy of that religion. However, my father
insisted, and I was allowed to enter. We
first of all partook of a dinner without meat,
consisting of bamboo sprouts, salt vegetables,
and a purée of beans, all of which
seemed delicious to me. We were afterwards
allowed to be present at the great
dinner of the priests. Their immense
dining-room resembled very much that
of a barracks, with this difference, however,
that during the meal the strictest
silence was observed. This silence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
only broken by the prayers that were sung
before and after each course. I was very
surprised to see how healthy these monks
looked in spite of their bad food. I have
since learnt, however, that a vegetable diet
is quite as nourishing as meat, and now
understand what at the time puzzled me.
On leaving the dining-room I took a turn
in the passage of meditation. Each priest
was seated with his legs crossed under him,
his eyes closed, and his hands locked together,
on a bed placed in an alcove, which
was separated by screens on either sides
from those of his neighbours. The priests
seemed to be lost in the most profound
meditation. Child that I was, and not
knowing what importance they attached
to their silence, I tried to get the monks
to speak to me, in spite of my father’s forbidding
me to speak to them. But not one
of them gave me any answer, not one of
them moved a hair. Some time was spent
in this way, after which we betook ourselves
to the great hall of consecration, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
ordination ceremony, as described above,
took place.</p>

<p>The net result of my excursion was that
I passed a very unpleasant night, and that
I have still before my eyes the horrible
sight of hundreds of Buddhists in their grey
robes, with their bald heads flaming hideously.</p>

<p>As soon as ever day broke I begged my
father to take me away from this sinister
spot, and in spite of the heavy dew that
lay on the grass, and the chilliness of the
spring morning, we set out at once. As
we reached a little pathway which separated
two fields, I just escaped treading on two
snakes, who were wriggling in battle together,
and who passed from one field into
another between my very legs.</p>

<p>The impression that I carried away was
so deplorable a one that, but for an incident
which, happening some days later, showed
me that their fanaticism was far from being
so absolute as I had imagined, I should
never have felt anything but aversion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
these fanatical madmen, as I then considered
them. One day, some time after our visit
to the monastery, one of the priests whom
we had met there paid us a visit at our
house, and stayed to dinner. I cannot
express the stupefaction I felt in seeing
him partake of the dishes of meat that
were served, with the greatest relish and
appetite. I could not understand. I knew
that the Buddhists were strict vegetarians,
and that they forbid the use not only of
flesh and fish, but even of eggs, fat, milk,
and butter. I could not help expressing
my astonishment, child that I was. The
priest merely smiled, and said, “Buddha
is such a kindly god, my child, that he pays
no attention to these minor details.”</p>

<p>Buddha, indeed, is the god of gladness.
I need only look at his face to be convinced
of that fact. This face, with the
fat cheeks, lighted up with an eternal smile;
this well-fed body, comfortably seated on
the lotus-flower, that flower that the god
holds in his hand; that quiet attitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
happy <i lang="fr">bon vivant</i>—all these things made
one think rather of some fat monk from
Rabelais than of an ascetic emaciated with
prayer and self-inflicted punishment.</p>

<p>The Buddhist story relates, moreover,
that the first Buddha was a man of kindly
feelings towards his fellows, whose only
mission it was to save all mortals from
their wretchedness, and to make them
enter the “western heaven,” which is that
of pleasure.</p>

<p>The other day my friend Cernuschi gave
a children’s ball in Paris. There was a
large Buddha in the drawing-room. I
happened to be present; and when I was
asked whether I was not horrified at seeing
such frivolities taking place before the
statue of a god, I answered in the negative.
“Ah,” they cried, “you are more
tolerant than we are. Our priests would
never permit us to dance before a crucifix.”</p>

<p>“That is quite different,” I answered.
“Christ was a martyr, and it would certainly
be wrong to indulge in frivolous gaieties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
before His image. Buddha, on the other
hand, has only one desire, and that is, that
each and all should be happy. Besides,
this excellent god is on a holiday in Europe,
and that is all the more reason why he
should be glad to see people amusing themselves,
since he is here for amusement.”</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The districts in China most favoured
by nature are, without doubt, Hang-Tcheou
and Sou-Tcheou. The
first possesses the lake of Sou-Hou, rich
in beautiful surroundings. The river Tchinn-Houai
flows through the second.</p>

<p>A very popular Chinese proverb says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Heaven is what is most beautiful in the skies, on
earth it is Sou and Hang.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the evening the lake and the river
are covered with illuminated pleasure boats.
Songs and laughter echo on every side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
The banks are covered with villas glittering
with light, where happy faces and charming
features may be seen.</p>

<p>These villas are inhabited by the most
beautiful women, who come to this wonderful
land to admire the beautiful scenery, and
to be admired in their turn. It has been
said—such is the reputation of this enchanting
spot—that at Hang-Tcheou the moon,
instead of being sad at times, is always very
happy, as if to share in the general gladness.
What songs of love has she not inspired,
what poems, what music, born of the contemplation
of her orb, more beautiful here
than anywhere else. I will add that the
prettiest women in China are born in these
two provinces.</p>

<p>Sou-Tcheou has, besides its river, a lake
called Tai-Hou, in which are a number of
mountainous islands. The most celebrated
of these are the Toung-Ting-Chan group,
which are much loftier than the others. In
autumn, when the Virginia creepers have
turned to red amidst the green of the pine-trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and the bamboo, the aspect is a most
picturesque one.</p>

<p>To the west of the town there is a mountain
known as the “Magic Rock,” where
there is the grotto of Si-Si, the favourite of
Prince Ou-Ouang of Sou-Tcheou, the most
beautiful woman in China, and quite close
to it are the Lake of Flowers, the Pathways
of Pleasant Odours, and the King’s Peak.
From the top of this peak, a view of the
Toung-Ting mountain, rising a mass of green
out of the snow-white lake, may be obtained.</p>

<p>There is another mountain to the north-east,
called Fou-Kiou, or the Tomb of the
Panther. The story is, that when Emperor
Tchin-Sse-Houang wanted to break into the
tomb of Prince Ou-Ouang, a tiger appeared
on the tomb and protected it, whence its
name. Lower down is a tomb which has
been preserved for over eight centuries, and
which contains the body of a young woman
renowned for her misfortunes in love. The
few poems of hers that have survived are
so very sad, that all persons of a romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
turn of mind who have read them never fail
to pay a visit to her tomb, and to cover it
with flowers.</p>

<p>Here is a short poem written by this heartbroken
woman:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I prostrate myself before the Buddhist Virgin, so full of pity and of charity,</div>
<div class="verse">To beg her to grant that in my future life I may neither revisit earth nor tarry in Paradise;</div>
<div class="verse">I pray that she may bless me with a drop of dew at the end of her willow branch,</div>
<div class="verse">So that I may become a double lotus blossom.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The third line contains an allusion to the
Buddhist ceremony of aspersion. The double
lotus-flower is supposed to bear on the same
stalk a male and a female blossom. It is the
emblem of the union of two hearts and of
happy loves.</p>

<p>The marble of the tomb is covered with
inscriptions made by the visitors. Most of
these are in verse, of the same metre and
with the same rhymes used by the dead
poetess.</p>

<p>Some way off is another mountain, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Lao-Tse spent a long time in meditation.
In the centre of this mountain is a large lake,
known as the “Celestial Lake,” where, in
summer, lotuses of extraordinary size may be
seen in flower. It used to be said that by eating
these flowers one attained immortality.</p>

<p>All this district is full of celebrated places
and of historical sites. Generally speaking,
there is a monastery on the top of each of
the mountains. In the middle of the spring
all the ladies of the district make offerings to
Buddha.</p>

<p>Those who admire pretty women take
advantage of this custom to come and stare
at the ladies.</p>

<p>The monastery is reached in sedan-chairs.
The ladies go down again backwards. I
never could understand the reason of this
strange custom until chance brought under
my notice these two lines, written in the
seventeenth century by a woman:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I go down stepping backwards, and you follow me face to face,</div>
<div class="verse">So that it is not necessary for me to turn my head round at each step.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>There are even more celebrated places at
Hang-Tcheou. In the first place, there is
Si-Hou, mentioned above. An avenue of
weeping willows surrounds the whole lake,
and the branches of the trees droop down
into the water. Behind is an immense
panorama of mountains—the Phœnix Mountain,
the Mountains of the Screen of Stone,
the Solitary Mountain, and the Mountain
of the Pumpkin, which was the favourite
walk of Emperor Tchin-Sse-Houang. This
destroyer of books used often to land at the
foot of this mountain, leaving his boat on
the lake while he made his excursion. Then
there are the Mountain of Music, against
which the current breaks and is driven back
with terrible noise; the Mountain of the
White Dragon, the Mountain of Sans-Souci,
where may still be found the utensils in
which the immortals, according to the legend,
used to prepare their magic remedies in
the old days. I may also name the Celestial
Pillar, the Fist, the Eye of Heaven,
and the Marble Mirror, which is formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of a huge round rock so smooth and polished,
that one can see his reflection in it as in
a mirror. Emperor Tchiao-Tchung, of the
Thang family, used often to give dinners
on this marble table. The guests used to
spread their cloaks out on the rocks which
stand around, and on this account the Emperor
called these rocks Marechal-I-King,
which means the embroidered garment.
The following story is told about the Flying
Mountain: “An Indian priest, seeing it
for the first time, appeared quite dumfounded
with astonishment. He was asked
what was the matter. ‘This mountain,’ he
answered, ‘belongs to my country. I do not
know when it can have flown here.’”</p>

<p>Beyond the summit of the Ten Thousand
Pine Trees, we see the Mountain of the
Red Twilight, so called because in the spring
the peach-trees, with which it is covered,
blossom with their pink flowers, and give this
mountain the appearance of being bathed in
the ruddy glow of dawn or twilight.</p>

<p>In this district there are a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
little lakes and merry rivulets, which have
poetic names. A part of the shore of Si-Hou
is called the Quay of Master Sou,
because Sou-Toung-Po had nenuphars and
other flowers planted there. Many poets
have written about this lake. The most
celebrated is the following, which was written
by Sou-Toung-Po:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Compare the lake to Si-Si.</div>
<div class="verse">It is more simple and prettier, because it is less made up.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A more modern author says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The traveller finds himself in the middle of a picture, and can easily believe that all these picturesque constructions are made of embroidery, so I am no longer surprised that the Choung dynasty</div>
<div class="verse">Preferred this lake to the half of their empire.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following is still more enthusiastic:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ten leagues of lotuses and an autumn rich in koue flowers</div>
<div class="verse">Attract the sovereign to them.</div>
<div class="verse">The new melody, entitled, ‘Song of the Willows,’</div>
<div class="verse">Is sung by every mouth.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<div class="verse">This is what has changed the capital of the empire,</div>
<div class="verse">And has caused Pien-Theou to be deserted for Hang-Tcheou.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another poem, the last, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The perfumed zephyr embalms the light of the moon,</div>
<div class="verse">Athwart the twelve stories of the mountain;</div>
<div class="verse">The Court ascends in the night to the Pavilion of Leisure,</div>
<div class="verse">Enjoying the panorama from above,</div>
<div class="verse">Which offers a charming view at the moment when all the houses are lighting up.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This will suffice to give an idea of these
landscapes, the most beautiful in China.
The views are of infinite variety, and each
point has some natural charm, or has attaching
to it some memorable event, historical
or legendary. So it is very difficult to
represent all there is to be described here,
even with the paint-brush. Man is unable
to portray all the beauties which Nature,
the real artist, so prodigiously displays.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">There was a tropical heat that day,
not a breath of wind stirring, and
not a shady corner to be found
anywhere. It was one of those stifling and
suffocating days of our Chinese summer.
I was trying to find some place where to
spend the afternoon with some degree of
comfort, when some one knocked at my
door.</p>

<p>They were friends of mine, who had come
to ask me to go bathing with them. They
had been considerate enough to bring a
sedan-chair for my use with them, and so
off we went.</p>

<p>Beyond the N.E. gate of Fou-Tcheou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
there is a warm sulphurous spring, which
is very much frequented by the inhabitants
of the town. Some go and bathe in the
common pool, which is reserved for the cure
of diseases of the skin; others, who come
either for cleanliness or merely for pleasure,
take private cabins. I need not say that
there are separate pools for the two sexes.</p>

<p>There is nothing picturesque about the
bathing pools, and so I will not describe them;
but I should like to say a few words about
the inner arrangements, which have nothing
in common with those in similar establishments
in Europe or Turkey.</p>

<p>The house is always built in the middle
of lofty trees, and its foundations are sunk,
wherever possible, in a running stream.
The building, which is one or, at most,
two storeys in height, is reached through a
vast peristyle. The shape of the house is
either round or square, either all in glass,
or else abundantly lighted with windows
made of silk, or of transparent paper, in
carved wood frames. Against the windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
on the front are placed little tables, spaced
out like those in a restaurant. The cabins
are behind. As soon as the bathers arrive
they are received by the employés, and,
when they have taken their seats, tea and
pipes of tobacco are served. At the same
time each bather receives some water-melon
seeds to help him to while away the time
whilst he is waiting for his bath. Then the
water-carriers begin to busy themselves,
carrying smoking pails of hot water, which
they have just drawn from the spring.</p>

<p>There is a round bath in each cabin, and
across it is laid a plank, on which the bather
sits without plunging his body into the
water. He is provided with a large sponge,
and uses it to sponge himself all over with
the hot water in the bath. As soon as the
bath is finished the bather dresses and returns
to his table, where a lunch is served,
composed of light and exquisite dishes.
Here the bathers drink wine, laugh, and
talk, or play at the game which resembles
the Italian game of “morra,” where you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
have to guess the number of fingers which
are held up by the players. The loser
has to drink. Fortunately the cups are
very small, or it wouldn’t be possible to
lose very often. After dinner, card games
are played, or chess, or dominoes. An
orchestra attached to the establishment
plays its sweetest melodies.</p>

<p>Thus the rest of the afternoon is spent in
the fresh air, under the shadow of the high
trees, with their thick leaves. It is, as you
see, a kind of hydropathic casino. As soon
as the sun has set, and before the moon
is too bright, a move homewards is made
across the fields in the sedan-chairs.</p>

<p>In the north the baths are inside the
towns, and thus are not so well situated as
where they are in the country. The arrangements
are, however, almost the same
as those I have described, except that
incense is burned in each cabin, and in such
quantities, that as you enter the thick smoke
gets into your eyes and makes them smart
and water. The reader will notice that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
only speak about warm baths. I must explain
that the Chinese do not like cold
baths, which they consider to be very bad
for the health. It is only the children of
people living by the river-sides who take
cold baths. Cold water is so generally
disliked in China, that lukewarm water is
almost always used for washing. We won’t
even drink cold water, and that is one of
the reasons why tea is so largely used at
home, the infusion giving us an excuse for
drinking hot water.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>KITE FLYING</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-k.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Kite-flying, which since the
earliest ages has been popular in
China, is, without possible contradiction,
the game which best exercises
the bodies of children. The boy runs back,
comes, goes, pulls at the string, winds it
up, inhales the fresh air with all his lung-power,
and develops his strength and his
skill at one and the same time.</p>

<p>In Northern and Central China it is in
the spring that this pastime is indulged in;
in the south it is in the autumn. Our
kites, as a rule, are much larger than those
used in Europe, and we designate their
sizes by the number of pieces of paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
that have been used in their manufacture.
Thus we speak of “two-paper,” “three-paper,”
and “thirty-two-paper” kites. The
last are very much taller than a man.</p>

<p>The form varies very much. Our “paper
eagles,” as we call them, are made in every
conceivable shape—butterflies, beetles, birds
of the most varied sizes and species, monstrous
dragons, are all in turn modelled in
the manufacture of these charming toys.</p>

<p>The strings vary, according to the size
of the kite, in thickness from the finest
thread to cord often several millimètres
thick. In the season, the sky is clouded
with these artificial birds, casting fantastic
shadows as they float in the ethereal
blue.</p>

<p>It is said that, one day, a player having
to absent himself for a moment, tied the
string of his kite to the cradle in which
his child was sleeping. When he came
back he found that his kite had got away,
carrying the cradle and the child with it.
Neither were ever seen or heard of again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The very large kites do not always carry
children away, but, on the other hand, they
often are very quarrelsome beings. The
kites which are intended for the purpose
of aerial warfare can be recognised by the
colour of the paper that they are made of.
One can thus see at once what is the
character—pacific or bellicose—of each new
comer. Often, the two possessors of the
fighting kites cannot see each other, but
only the two kites they are fighting with.
Each child tries by skilful manœuvring of
the string to get his kite behind that of
his adversary, and hook it on to the other.
When he has done this, he draws his
string in, and, if he is the stronger, is
able to bring both kites down to the ground,
cuts the string of the enemy’s kite, patches
up its wounds, and adds it to his collection.
Other kites are more peaceful, devoted as
they are to music—the civilising art. A
bow, crossed by several parallel chords,
is fastened to the three strings which cross
the face of the flying-machine, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
wind, playing through these cords, causes
them to vibrate, giving the music of the
Æolian harp. Some children get to be
very skilful at this game, and it is really
an interesting sight to see them vieing in
force and ruse with each other to obtain
these never bloody victories.</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Our forefathers used to say that to
find pleasure it must be sought
for either on the mountains or on
the water, and it is quite true that if you
want to enjoy fine weather, you must look
out for some place where the views are
varied. But, as Mahomet very wisely
remarked, the mountains won’t come to us,
and we must go to the mountains. It
must also be remarked that there are many
flat districts in China where there are no
mountains to be found, whilst water can
be found everywhere; besides, mountain-climbing
is fatiguing, whilst excursions on
the water in flower-decked canoes, comfortably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
fitted, afford both repose and pleasure,
cradled as one is by the rhythmic cadence of
the oars. When the wind is strong enough
to allow of a sail being hoisted, you feel
almost as light as a bird flying in space; and
let the illusion last ever so short a time, you
fancy you have been transformed into a
member of the aerial world of genii, pursuing
in cloudland a life of eternal happiness.</p>

<p>My countrymen have in all ages taken
special pleasure in excursions on the water.
Under the dynasty of the Sungs—that is, in
the twelfth century—Lake Loi was very
much frequented. The shores were planted
all round with weeping willows, and the
moon seemed to lose seven-tenths of her
brightness under the gleam of the numberless
illuminated boats sailing along to the
sound of joyous music.</p>

<p>A poet has said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“By moonlight on the twenty-four bridges,</div>
<div class="verse">The sweet melody may everywhere be heard, the melody of flutes, sonorous at the lips of charming women.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<p>The river Tchiang-Hang became the
favourite excursion under the reign of the
Thangs. At the beginning of the spring
people used to go out to it to collect aquatic
flowers. This is expressed in these lines:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On the third day of the third moon—the birth
of spring—the banks of the river Tchiang-Hang
are lined with pretty women.”</p>

</div>

<p>When Sung came to the throne, he used
to make his excursions chiefly on Lake Si-Hou,
the beautiful lake in the west, which
we have already described. The skiffs flew
like fly-shuttles across the loom, cutting
through the light mist that rose from the
water; and blue flags were to be seen on
every tree. The lake used at that time to
be called the Crucible for Melting Gold, a
metaphor which is not without point.</p>

<p>Three centuries ago, under the reign of
the Mings, the river Tching-Houai began
to grow fashionable, and as the moon rose
with the tide, thousands of boats, covering
more than ten lis (Chinese miles), could be
seen hieing hither, with their pearly blinds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
casting shadows which trembled on the
trouble of the waters. All that has disappeared
to-day. One must have been in
these boats to understand the real pleasure
of a taskless and careless life. They are
like floating houses, furnished with the most
refined luxury. Each boat is rowed by six
oarsmen, and is fitted in the centre with a
deck-house, which is divided off into several
drawing-rooms. Nothing more artistically
and comfortably arranged can be found even
in the wealthiest houses in Europe. In the
evening, bright lights shine through the
window-panes of all the cabins, and it is as if
the water were furrowed up with thousands
of meteors shedding their joyful brightness
far and wide. No; there is no better mode
of locomotion. On the water there is no
dust; you do not run, you skim along, and
the slow progress of the skiff gives you time
to enjoy the varied aspects of the country,
studded as it is with clusters of sombre and
silent trees. Then all that a carriage can do
for you is to convey you; you can’t settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
down in a carriage. These boats, on the
other hand, are so many houses, where
whole families or large parties can meet
together and dwell. To conclude, the boat
alone deprives the landscape of its immobility,
animates it, and gives it movement
and life; it renders Nature herself more
gay and more poetical.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>GARDENING</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A rather curious coincidence
exists in the two antipodes of
the globe. In France, when a
man retires from business or from official
life, he says, “I am going to plant cabbages.”
In China we say, “I am going
to retire into the mountains, or into the
forest.” This is another way of saying that
he is going to give himself up to gardening.
This coincidence is caused by the fact that
the same tastes exist everywhere. When a
man has had enough of the occupations of
an active life, he is glad to withdraw completely
from them, and to devote himself to
innocent pleasure, which provides exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
for the body and rest for the mind, and
charms with peace the last days of his life.
What is called the world differs but little.
When one is tired of its battles, it is that
other world, the world of nature, that alone
one yearns after.</p>

<p>In our history, as in our poetry, we are
constantly reading of men of the widest
fame who only lived in the hope of being
able to retire at last. They often used to
be heard saying that their gardens were
running to waste for want of cultivation;
and this thought is so popular a one, that
even those who cling to their offices follow
the example of the others, and constantly
repeat that they are dying with the longing
to go and cultivate their gardens. A
philosopher thus characterises this contradiction
between the word and the act:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Everybody expresses the desire to retire,</div>
<div class="verse">But in the middle of the forest I never meet anybody.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>However this may be, it is certain that
a number of people do caress this dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of a rural life, and do finally put it into
execution.</p>

<p>“O rus quando te aspiciam,” is true in
every age, and in every land; on the banks
of the blue river, as well as in the severe
landscapes of ancient Rome, or on the
sunny landscapes of modern France.</p>

<p>The poet Tou-Fou himself, when his
functions at Court allowed him a few moments
of leisure, took great delight in
donning gardener’s clothes, as is shown
by the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I met Tou-Fou at the foot of the Fan-Kou mountain, wearing a straw hat in the full heat of the sun.</div>
<div class="verse">‘Why are you so thin?’ I asked him.</div>
<div class="verse">‘Because,’ he answered, ‘I have been making too many verses of late.’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tao-Yen-Ming, the man of letters, is
the author of a long piece, entitled “Back
in the Country,” of which the following is
the principal passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“My garden was just beginning to run wild,</div>
<div class="verse">But happily there still remain pines and chrysanthemums.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Having cultivated myself I return home,</div>
<div class="verse">Where my young boy jumps into my lap,</div>
<div class="verse">And a vase of wine awaits me on the table.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And this man of letters, in spite of
repeated invitations from the Emperor,
contented himself with living and dying
in the midst of his chrysanthemums, which
he loved passionately.</p>

<p>We are not, however, satisfied in China
with mere cultivation, but have succeeded
in developing our gardening operations into
a real work of art. What with watering,
grafting, the selection and scientific combinations
of species, the great varieties both
of our plants and our skill in shaping them
into the most varied and most fantastic
shapes, our gardens are veritable masterpieces
of the art. The Chinese gardeners
know how to transform their gardens into
zoological gardens, cutting and bending
their trees, as they do, into lions, dragons,
and every other kind of animal. We are so
fond of flowers, that a single spray is considered
sufficient for a bouquet. One never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
sees those round bouquets of several kinds
of flowers, which are fashionable in Europe,
at home.</p>

<p>Listen to the following verses written by
an amateur gardener:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What an admirable sight is this sunset,</div>
<div class="verse">Which like Bengal fire shows everything ‘en rose,’</div>
<div class="verse">The flowers seem much prettier,</div>
<div class="verse">And the birds hop about, chirping on the branches of the bamboo.</div>
<div class="verse">The wind has calmed down, the trees are wrapped in silence,</div>
<div class="verse">And shades are stealthily creeping over all the land.</div>
<div class="verse">My breast swells, but as much with fresh air as with gladness.</div>
<div class="verse">But, alas, the day, approaching its end, holds no further prospect of happiness.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Do not think that to be happy the Chinaman
must have a large estate. It is the
quality of the philosopher to be satisfied
with very little. A small plot of land is all-sufficient
for his happiness, provided he has
a few square yards of soil in which to plant
his bamboo and his favourite flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is a poem written by a
man of letters, who lived in a cottage, and
consoled himself in this wise:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“There is no reason why the mountain should be lofty;</div>
<div class="verse">It is celebrated by the genius who inhabits it.</div>
<div class="verse">Water need not be deep, if it is inhabited by a dragon.</div>
<div class="verse">My home is only a cottage, sheltering my virtue and my person.</div>
<div class="verse">Moss covers the steps; and the green of the lawn</div>
<div class="verse">Is reflected through my window-blinds;</div>
<div class="verse">But only men of letters come to laugh and to talk with me.</div>
<div class="verse">No vulgar man ever sets his foot here.</div>
<div class="verse">We can have nice games of skill.</div>
<div class="verse">We can read nice Buddhist books.</div>
<div class="verse">No sound of music troubles my ears.</div>
<div class="verse">No political element absorbs our minds.</div>
<div class="verse">I compare my cottage to the celebrated cottage of Nan-Yang,</div>
<div class="verse">Or to the historical pavilion of Si-Seu.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Moreover, has not Confucius written as
follows?—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>I pause here to tell an anecdote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A foreign diplomat told me one day, whilst we
were sitting chatting and smoking cigarettes in his
study, that under the reign of Frederick the Great
a Chinese dignitary came to Berlin. He was well
received at Court, and introduced forthwith to a
professor, who enjoyed a great reputation in the
German capital for his translations of Chinese literature
and his lessons in the Chinese language.</p>

<p>“The mission of this Chinese dignitary lasted
several years, at the end of which time a real
professor arrived from abroad. He was at once
brought into the presence of the Chinese professor.</p>

<p>“Imagine his stupefaction when he discovered that
this individual was not a professor at all, and that
his real profession was that of a gardener. He had
been forced to play the rôle of professor against
his will. He was taken to be a savant, and a
savant he had to be. On his arrival in Germany
he had been at once considered a man of letters on
the strength of his appearance only, without having
to give any proof of his capacities, or to pass any
examination. Not to injure this victim of a mistake,
and to take advantage of his talents, he was appointed
gardener at Sans-Souci, where, as it happens, I
noticed several specimens of Chinese gardening
operations.”</p>

</div>

<p>I cannot vouch for the truth of the
preceding anecdote, but, true or false, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
story is amusing enough to be related.
After all, the man only had to change
the course of his studies, and from being
a professor of Chinese, developed into a
professor of Chinese gardening.</p>

<p>A man of letters, named Ko-To-Tao
(To-Tao means the humpback, a soubriquet
given to the man whose real name
nobody knew, and who seemed to enjoy
his nickname), used to dwell in the village
Foun-Lo (fertility and joy), which lies to
the west of Tchiang-Nyang. He used to
cultivate trees, which were so beautiful that
they were the envy of all the rich people
of the province, and all the traders bought
from him. All the incomparable plants
which came from his garden flourished
and grew much quicker than any others.
Some one asked him what was the secret
of his success. He answered that there was
no secret in the matter. All that he did
was merely to study the individual character
of the plant, and to treat it accordingly.</p>

<p>“When you plant a tree,” he said, “you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
must make it comfortable, give it plenty
of room to grow in, and see that the soil
in which it is planted is rich and solid.
Then you must leave it alone, not move
it about. From time to time, treat it with
the care that you would show to your
own child. Don’t spoil it, when it is in
want of nothing. Thus brought up the
tree is free, and thrives, as it is its nature
to do. I do not prevent its development,
which comes of its own accord. Others
who plant trees often change the earth
round it, making it sometimes too strong,
sometimes too poor, and spoil their pupils
by too much care. Not satisfied with
looking at them, they touch them; sometimes
even they cut into the bark to see
if they are living or dead. No sooner
have the buds sprouted, than they examine
them to see if they will turn into fruit.
The tree is not free, and its character
changes. You think that you are showing
love, but you are destroying. You are
trying to show care, and you are dealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
death. That is why my system is superior
to all others. But in all that I have no
particular merit.”</p>

<p>He was asked if the same system could
be applied in government offices.</p>

<p>“No; I know nothing about anything
but trees. It is not my trade to govern
nations. I have seen good governments,
who, instead of leaving people free to
work, took them under their protection.
Then each day brought with it its sheaf
of decrees and laws, ordering people into
the fields and to their trades, and regulating
their customs and ways of living. The
people, being no longer master of itself
or of its movements, comes to no good.
As for myself, I am old and infirm, and
occupy myself with my trees alone.”</p>

<p>The person who had been talking with
him, delighted to have learned the true
system of government, whilst endeavouring
to learn how to plant trees, wrote down
the conversation for the instruction of the
government officials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>After all, there is little difference between
the education of a tree and of a man.
Our forefathers used to say that it takes
a century to complete the education of
a man, and that the proper education of
a tree lasts at least ten years.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE CHASE</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">According to the Book of Rites,
the Emperor and the Royal Princes
had to go to the chase whenever
politics allowed them any leisure. As for
the people, the chase was a military exercise,
which they took after harvest-time. The
book of verses mentions stalking in carriages.
Emperor Chuang-Ouong, after having
reconquered the territory, used to hunt
in his carriage with his feudal princes, so
as to see which of them were likely to become
the bravest soldiers. Holidays were
selected for hunting excursions. There was
also at that time a special government
department, whose duty it was to see to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the preservation and propagation of certain
kinds of animals.</p>

<p>In the winter it was the wolves that
were hunted, in the summer the deer, in
the spring all other kinds of animals. Birds
were hunted in the autumn. Bows and
arrows were used, and the sportsmen had
reached to such a degree of skill in archery,
that they could transfix a leaf at the top
of a tree. A celebrated hunter, named Kia-Kieng,
only shot with a bow, which was so
strong and tough that it needed a force of
three hundredweight to stretch the string.
One day he was asked to shoot at a buffalo
at a distance of one hundred paces. His
first arrow grazed the animal’s back, tearing
away a few hairs; the second grazed its belly.
The archer was told that that was not good
shooting. He said that it was just his
superiority that he knew how not to pierce
the animal. “But if you like,” he said, “I
will do so.” His third arrow killed the
buffalo.</p>

<p>With every shooting-party were taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
an eagle and dogs, the latter wearing
golden bells round their necks. At an
official chase the Minister of War himself
stood up on a high platform, and a large
standard was displayed at his back. The
hunters, who were always accompanied
with a noisy orchestra, and standard-bearers
carrying flags of every colour,
pursued the quarry, as soldiers pursuing
an enemy.</p>

<p>Excess in all being a fault, many official
hunters, owing to the encouragement held
out by the State, gave themselves up
entirely to this sport, totally neglecting all
public business. In consequence of this,
the Censors and other reasonable people
advised the sovereign to moderate the laws,
preferring to deprive themselves of their
pleasure in the interest of the commonwealth.
The chase was accordingly somewhat
restricted by law, and began to be
neglected.</p>

<p>An Emperor of the dynasty of the Liangs,
noticing when he was out one day shooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
that a flock of wild duck had settled down
in the field before him, drew his bow, and
was just about to let fly, when a peasant
passed in his line of fire. In spite of the
cries of the attendants the peasant walked
on his way, deaf and blind to their cries
and their signals. Meanwhile the birds
flew away. The Emperor was very
angry, and spoke of shooting the peasant.
One of his ministers who was out sporting
with him, said, “Don’t kill a man
because game is wanting. A king must
not be as savage as the beast that he
hunts.”</p>

<p>His Majesty, recovering from his anger,
smiled, and took the arm of his councillor
to re-enter his carriage. When he had
reached home empty-handed he said, “I
have had a very successful day, for instead
of bringing home a good bag, I have had
a good lesson.”</p>

<p>Under the present dynasty the Court
used to go out to the chase from time
to time, and men of letters used to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
part in these excursions. Whenever a
member of the Academy of Han-Lin shot
a stag, he at once received a decoration
of peacock’s feathers. Since about thirty
years, however, this institution has been
neglected, as we have only had minors
on the throne. But as the reigning sovereign
has reached his majority, it is probable
that before long he will return to
these pleasures, which are as useful as
they are agreeable.</p>

<p>There are no game-laws in China.
Everybody has the right to shoot wherever
game is to be found. It is quite
usual for a landowner to see sportsmen
walking about his estates with their guns
on their shoulders, doing as if they were
on their own lands. The golden pheasant
is found in great quantities in China. It
is one of the favourite pastimes of Europeans
who live in China to shoot these
splendid birds. Amongst other feathered
game that we possess in China, I may
mention woodcock, snipe, quail, wild duck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and wild goose. In the way of fur we
have stags, deer, roes, rabbits, and hares;
besides foxes, wolves, bears, panthers, and
tigers. Imitators of Nimrod will find plenty
of sport in China.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>FISHING</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">If a certain number of men of letters
take refuge in the pleasures of
gardening, fishing also has its
number of votaries. The bulk of these
are men who, having lost all the illusions
of life, and finding that politics are, after
all, a hollow mockery, give themselves up to
a quieter and less disappointing pastime.</p>

<p>The philosopher Tchang-Tseu used to
fish on the banks of the river Han every
day of his life. The Prince of Tchou,
having heard him spoken about, sent an
ambassador one day to the philosopher to
beg him to enter the political life. Tchang-Tseu,
his rod in his hand, spoke to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
fish without condescending to give any
answer, finding that it was not worth while
to do so. Another, still further back in
history, by name Lu-Chan, used to pass
his days in fishing in the river Pien. Emperor
Weng-Ouang went one day in person
to beg him to become one of his councillors,
and appointed him, on the spot, Guardian
of the Sovereign. Lu-Chan accepted the
offer, and helped his master to rule his
empire. The dynasty lasted eight hundred
years, so solidly had the basis of the government
been established by the fisher-minister.
His master was the first Emperor of China
who got the name of Saint. The people
were never happier than under his reign.
So great was the general prosperity, that
even now-a-days, when they want to speak
of a happy people, the Chinese say, “As
if they were walking about under the reign
of Weng-Ouang.”</p>

<p>Another fisher, of Tsou-Kiang, who always
trafficked his fish and wine, used to
drink his fill, and then dance and sing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
his boat on the water, thinking himself the
happiest man on earth. The prefect went
to ask him if he was a genuine fisherman,
or whether he concealed his identity under
this disguise, and was a person of importance.
“Never you mind,” he said to the prefect.
“Historical persons fish for titles, I satisfy
myself with fishing for fish.”</p>

<p>Under the reign of the Thangs, a man
of letters, named Thiang-Tseu-Ho, withdrew
on to the water and set up his abode on
board a boat, which he called his floating-house,
and gave himself the title of Fisher,
in the midst of the waves and the mist. He
published a quantity of songs for fishermen
and oarsmen, which he was in the habit
of singing on his aquatic excursions. The
Emperor, taking pity on his solitude, sent,
as a present, two servants, a young man
and a young woman. The recluse married
the two together, giving the name of Fisherman
to the lad, and that of Shepherdess to
the lass. The one looked after the fishing-tackle
and rowed the boat, the other used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to go into the forest to gather dry wood
and bamboos to make his tea.</p>

<p>History mentions the names of several
fishermen of this philosophical class. There
are besides these only professional fishermen,
good folk who work hard, and live on very
little.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that we have a goddess
of the sea, but her story is not so generally
known. She was the daughter of a family
of fishermen who lived on the shore of Mei-Tcheou,
quite close to Fou-Tcheou. Her
father and her brothers used to go out fishing
on the sea every day, each in his own
boat, whilst she stayed at home to weave in
the company of her old mother. She was
adored by her parents, whom she loved very
much. One day, during a storm which made
everybody feel drowsy, she was dozing at
the table, when she dreamed that her father’s
boat was just going to sink in the angry sea,
and putting out her hand she caught hold of
the painter to draw it into land. Meanwhile
she saw that the boats on which her brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
were, were in the same danger. So, putting
the first cord between her teeth, she caught
hold of the two others in her hands, and
began walking through the water towards
the shore. But before she could reach the
shore she began to groan and cry, and her
mother began to shake her, calling her by
name. To answer her mother she opened
her mouth and let the cord that she held
between her teeth escape. When she woke
up she thought that this was a nightmare;
but that evening, when her brothers came
home, they told her that her father had been
drowned. The young girl, in despair at not
having been able to save her father, who had
died through her fault, rushed out and threw
herself into the sea. Some time after she
was often seen in visions by fishermen in
moments of distress, and it was noticed that
whenever she appeared the danger was overcome.
Out of gratitude her protégés erected
a little temple in her honour. Little by little
her miraculous protection was extended to
the ships of travellers and great officials, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
even to the navy. For each service rendered
to the State a title was given her, and little
by little she became known by the appellation
of “Holy Mother of Heaven,” a title
which is accompanied by as many honorific
qualifications as are worn by the sovereigns
who delight to do her honour.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>CHARMING WOMAN</i><br />
COQUETRY</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">One is none the less a woman for
being a Chinese woman. Woman
is the same everywhere. It is she
who charms us—not to say who rules us.
And no matter in what part of the globe,
it is she who is always the great attraction
of life.</p>

<p>They all know it; and without any need
of a general understanding amongst themselves,
all the sisters of the universe do the
best they each can to render themselves
more beautiful, or prettier, or merely more
agreeable. They need for that no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
master that that instinctive desire to please,
which is a special feature of the female
nature. Albeit our women know neither
how to grow fat or thin, or how to dye
their hair, or how to make use of a thousand
other tricks, which beauty uses to repair the
irreparable ravages of time; they know how
to paint themselves, and how to adorn their
persons. They are very skilful in the use
of red paint for the lips, of black for the
eyebrows, and of white for the face. The
particular taste of each race modifies the
forms of coquetry. In Europe, you prefer
large eyes and a Grecian nose; in China,
small eyes and a thin and delicate nose
are considered the most beautiful. On the
other hand, we agree with you in admiring
fine white teeth, and little wrists and
ankles.</p>

<p>It is said, in China, that a woman’s eyebrows
should be elongated and thin, like the
silhouette of distant mountains; that the eyes
should be limpid, as water is in autumn; and
the lips red, like dawn of day. Dimples are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
greatly admired in China. We call them the
“wine hollows.”</p>

<p>The flush of the cheeks is called “the
colour of drunkenness.”</p>

<p>From Nature, let us pass on to Art.</p>

<p>Formerly, women used to dress their hair
high up on their heads, the coiffure being
built up on a framework of iron wire. Little
by little this style was modified, and to-day
the greatest simplicity is the rule. Our ladies
dress their hair almost in the Greek style,
with this difference, that the hair always
remains smooth, curls never having been in
fashion in China. I may add, that natural
curls are quite unknown at home. A gold
or silver pin, shaped like a double spatula,
and bent in the middle, is fixed in the
centre of the chignon, so as to keep the
hair in place. Sprigs of flowers are fixed
round this pin. Sometimes, in the spring,
a little wreath of scented flowers is put on
the back of the head. These simple ornaments
are so much appreciated, that many
ladies have a standing arrangement with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
gardener to bring them fresh flowers every
morning.</p>

<p>A poet has said about this custom:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“After having finished dressing her hair she casts another glance in her mirror,</div>
<div class="verse">To see what kind of flowers will best suit her hair.</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore, before changing her morning toilette,</div>
<div class="verse">Behold her setting forth for the garden with a pair of scissors in her hand.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When flowers are wanting, butterflies,
made in every conceivable shape, and of all
kinds of materials, are placed in the hair
above the temples. At grand ceremonies
imitation flowers, made in jewels, are used
instead of natural flowers.</p>

<p>The forehead is always left free. Only
young girls wear fringes, the rest of the hair
being allowed to fall down loose at the back
of the head, or being gathered up into two
bunches on either side. The enormous coiffure
that you see in pictures, and which forms
a kind of bull’s head, is known as the coiffure
in the style of “a crow with outstretched
wings.” It is now only to be seen in Canton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Ladies in China never wear hats or
bonnets. At ceremonies they wear a helmet-shaped
crown, and on less solemn occasions
a little band of embroidered stuff, which
crosses the forehead and terminates in points
behind each ear. In the centre is a large
pearl or other precious stone, and round it a
single or double row of pearls is entwined.
Women wear shorter clothes than the men,
the shape being about the same for both
sexes. The clothes come down to the
knees. On special occasions a petticoat,
which comes down to the feet, is worn,
while indoors a pair of trousers is added;
which in the north is fastened round the
ankles with ribbons, and left loose in the
south. The upper garment has wide sleeves,
with facings of embroidered satin. The uniform—for
ladies in China wear a uniform
on grand occasions suited to the rank of
their husbands—consists in a dress of red
satin, embroidered with dragons, over which
is a garment shaped like a waistcoat, also
embroidered. If the husband has a high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
rank, the wife also wears a pearl necklace.
Whatever may be the rank of the woman,
she always makes her own shoes. There
are no shops in China for the sale of women’s
shoes.</p>

<p>Jewels are never used for trimming dresses;
at the very utmost, a few gold or jewelled
buttons are sometimes used; but bracelets
are worn in great numbers, according to
the position and fortune of the wearer.
Some young girls wear ankle-bands, also
necklaces in the shape of collars, either in
silver or gold, and fastened with a locket
in the shape of a padlock.</p>

<p>The general custom of wearing the nails
very long has caused the use of a special
nail-glove, which is made of gold. It is
shaped like a thimble, open at both ends,
and is prolongated by a gold nail, which is
intended to cover the real nail and to protect
it. I may mention that in China, as
everywhere else, it is the demi-monde that
creates the fashions. But fashion varies
considerably in the different provinces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Only a few ladies, who have travelled a
great deal, know how to combine the various
styles, often with the happiest effect. As a
rule, one can tell at a glance to what province
a woman belongs.</p>

<p>One of the most feared of our Censors,
a man before the severity of whose criticism
the whole world used to tremble, and who
was all the more feared that nobody could
find any fault in him, was one day surprised
in the act of painting his wife’s eyebrows.
I leave you to judge how delighted his
enemies were to be able to tell the sovereign
that this rigid guardian of public
morality was, after all, but a very frivolous
man. The Censor was sent for and asked
if the report were true.</p>

<p>“Yes, your Majesty,” he answered; “but
what is there frivolous in that? Is not
everything allowed between man and wife?”</p>

<p>The Emperor was quite satisfied with
this answer, and the matter dropped. The
story is repeated everywhere now-a-days as
symbolic of domestic felicity. I see in it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
above all things, the triumph of feminine
coquetry, which knows how to subjugate
mankind, even the most austere, and enslaves
us to its delicious trivialities and
its irresistible frivolities.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>FANS</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">I say fans in the plural, because
we have two kinds, the folding
fan and the round fan. We use
the former during the mild seasons, and
the latter during the very hot weather.
The reason of this is not easily understood,
as the round fan fans much less effectively
than the other one. Doubtless it offers
this advantage—that it can be used as a
substitute for the parasol, which we never
carry, and thus plays a double part. I
may add, that in summer men and women
alike go out bareheaded, so that some protection,
such as is afforded by the screen
fan, is needed. As a general rule, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
is a picture on one side of our fans, and
some writing on the other. Common folk
buy their fans ready painted and written
upon, whereas people of fashion buy their
fans blank, and ask distinguished people to
illustrate them with a painting or a piece of
writing. Some collectors possess hundreds
of fans, which replace with us the autograph
albums that you have in Europe.</p>

<p>Fans are given as presents to one’s friends.
They are always given by schoolmasters as
prizes to their scholars.</p>

<p>The folding fan has a varying number
of stems. Women’s fans have generally
thirty thin stems. The most common are
made of bamboo; the best are made of
ivory, betel, or sandal wood. They are
carried in a case of embroidered satin,
which is fastened to the belt by a ring of
jade. The round fan is usually made of
silk, with ivory or bamboo handles, the
prolongation of which is either hidden between
a double mask of stuff, or is visible
on one side only. Ladies use them at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
play for catching butterflies, or fireflies at
night. On such occasions they fasten a
sachet of scent to the end of the handle,
which scents the air as the fan is moved.</p>

<p>The portrait of the fashionable poet of
the day is always to be seen painted on
the fan; thus Lu-Fong Oun, the popular
poet of the thirteenth century, was surnamed
Buddha of the Thousand Families,
because his portrait was to be seen everywhere,
and because his light and graceful
verses could be understood by everybody.
It is a very usual thing to compare a
friend to a fan, because of his refreshing
influence on the mind. A woman
who fancies that her husband’s heart is
hers no longer will compare herself, as
we shall see, to a fan cast aside in the
autumn.</p>

<p>A favourite named Pan-Tie-Tsu, beloved
at one time by Emperor Hiao-Tcheng,
seeing herself deserted, sent a fan to her
master, on which she had written the following
lines:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I have just woven with my own hands this white silk,</div>
<div class="verse">White as the snow and as the ice.</div>
<div class="verse">I cut it to make a fan of it,</div>
<div class="verse">Round as the full moon is.</div>
<div class="verse">I would wish that it might be with you wherever you may go,</div>
<div class="verse">And that the air it gives you may, from time to time, refresh your memory.</div>
<div class="verse">I foresee, however, that when autumn comes,</div>
<div class="verse">Or the cold weather shall reduce the heat of the day,</div>
<div class="verse">It will be cast aside into some box, and removed from the favour of your Majesty,</div>
<div class="verse">Even as she is who gave it to you.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another woman, who had been disfigured
by disease, sent her lover a fan, on which
she had written the four following lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh, the fan! Oh, the fan!</div>
<div class="verse">You serve to hide my unhappy face.</div>
<div class="verse">I am hideously ugly;</div>
<div class="verse">And I am ashamed to present myself before my lover.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Besides these two kinds of fans, there is
also the feather fan, which was first made in
the time of dynasty of the later Hans.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister, named Tsu-Kia-Liang,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
used this fan for all his military
commands. It was, in his hands, a substitute
for the field-marshal’s baton.</p>

<p>It is also said, that the first fan of this
kind was introduced into China by the
King of Siam, who sent it, with other
objects, by way of tribute. But Tsu-Kia-Liang
still, to-day, is represented with a
feather fan in his hand, the baton with
which he directed the orchestra in the
symphony of the battle.</p>

<p>Betel leaves, cut into the shape of a
fan, are also used in China. As this dry
leaf can neither be written nor painted
upon, it is decorated with engravings, either
of pictures or of writing, which are traced
upon it by means of a lighted stick of incense.
This delicate and difficult work is
generally done by women. Both leaves and
incense come from Formosa.</p>

<p>Another kind of fan is made in Canton.
A bamboo stick is taken, of which one
end is left to serve as handle. The upper
end is shredded into very fine threads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
which spread out into the shape of a lyre;
silk is passed over these, and the lower
part of the lyre is consolidated with a piece
of curved wood, through a hole in which
the handle passes. It is a very pretty kind
of fan, and wears very well indeed.</p>

<p>All these varieties are fancy articles.
In ancient China, the round fan alone was
known; the folding fan has only been
known since the last five centuries. It
was first presented by the Corean ambassadors
to Emperor Ung-Lo, of the Ming
dynasty. The sovereign found it not only
pretty, but very convenient, and less troublesome
to carry, and gave orders for the
manufacture of a large quantity, to be distributed
amongst the officials of his empire.</p>

<p>This is all that I consider it necessary
to say about fans in China. It may be
found that I have used a great many words
about very little. But how can words be
better used, since it was said of them by
an ancient Roman that they fly, than in
speaking about winds and fans?</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>CELEBRATED BEAUTIES</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-b.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Beautiful women are called in
China flowers, or jade jewels, or
still better, the destroyers of the
empire, or the destroyers of cities. The
latter nicknames originated in a poem of
the celebrated Li-Yan-Nein, of the dynasty
of Han, thus conceived:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A beautiful woman lives in the north,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose beauty has never in any age been rivalled;</div>
<div class="verse">To see her is to lose the empire.</div>
<div class="verse">If one sees her twice, the kingdom no longer exists.</div>
<div class="verse">But I may add, that one prefers to lose both empire and kingdom</div>
<div class="verse">Than to renounce the beautiful woman whom one will never see again.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>The poem fell under the eyes of the
Emperor, who immediately asked if such
a woman really did exist, or was only the
creation of the poet’s imagination. On
receiving an affirmative answer, he expressed
his desire to know this beauty, and
it was upon her that he afterwards bestowed
his exclusive favour. An Emperor
is no less a man.</p>

<p>One of the favourites of Emperor Han-Wou-Ti,
named Li-Kiang—pretty girl—conquered
the heart of her sovereign at
the age of fourteen. Her beauty was
perfect, and her body was of extreme
delicacy. She clothed herself alone in the
lightest tissues, for fear that coarser stuff
might injure her very delicate skin. Her
master built for her a crystal palace, so
that, as he said, no dust should come to
stain the whiteness of her darling person.
Her breath was so sweet, that when she
sang all the flowers in the garden danced.</p>

<p>Emperor Ouei-Weng-Ti, having heard
it said that a young girl named Sie-Ling-Yung,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
was reputed to be of incomparable
beauty, wrote to the prefect, bidding him to
send her to the capital. On bidding good-bye
to her parents, Sie-Ling-Yung wept
red tears, which were tears of blood.</p>

<p>Her reception at the capital was an extremely
brilliant one. The Court sent out
ten carriages to meet her, and sandal
leaves were burned all along the way she
was to pass through. A lofty tower was
erected for the occasion, and was illuminated,
as were all the houses in the city.</p>

<p>It was a memorable night, and is still
mentioned in our histories. His Majesty
went out in person to meet the beautiful
woman, driving in a carriage of carved
jade. At regular intervals bronze milestones,
two metres high, had been erected.
At last this marvellous woman was received
in the arms of the sovereign, who gave
her the name of Ye-Lae, which means “She
who came in the night.”</p>

<p>She was an incomparable artist at embroidery.
She could embroider in the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
masterpieces which could not be imitated
in daylight by any other woman. On account
of this she was also called “The
Genius of the Needle.”</p>

<p>The celebrated poet Soung-U says, in a
poem about his neighbour:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“All the beautiful women in the world</div>
<div class="verse">Are not worth my lady neighbour of the west.</div>
<div class="verse">Were you to add one inch to her height, she would be too tall;</div>
<div class="verse">Were you to reduce her stature by one inch, she would be too small.</div>
<div class="verse">Powder would give her too white a colour,</div>

</div>

<p>It is a matter of great regret in China
that the poet did not even mention the
name of this beauty, who, according to his
account, must have been as desirable a
person as she was desired by him.</p>

<p>When the famous Fi-Yen—The Flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Swallow—was presented to Emperor Yang-Ti,
he was transported with joy. Not only
was she beautiful, but her body was so
light, that the king used often to take her
up on one hand to play with her. In a
moment of effusion the Emperor said that
he had only one ambition in life, and that
was to live and die by the side of her
whom he loved, and that, unlike his ancestors,
he should not commit the folly of
seeking for the land of clouds, by which
he meant Paradise.</p>

<p>There have been so many celebrated
beauties in China, that it is quite impossible
to mention all their names here. Let us
be satisfied by saying, that some, when
they wash their hands in the streams, scent
the water; that others found their beauty
improved by a little wound on their faces;
that some shamed the flowers themselves;
and that one of them compelled the moon
to hide her face. All those who deserved
the name of beautiful woman, owed all
their charms to Nature; those that tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to imitate them, only rendered themselves
ridiculous. History relates apropos of this,
that the beautiful Si-Si used to have the
habit of laying her hand to her heart, which
gave her an additional charm. Another
woman, who lived in her village—thinking
that it was this gesture alone that caused
her neighbour to be so much admired—imitated
it, and got laughed at for her
trouble; for, as it was pointed out to her,
she had overlooked the fact that what is
natural is beautiful, whilst what is forced is
often absurd.</p>

<p>Men used to be magnificently gallant towards
these beautiful women. Some housed
them in golden palaces, others sheltered
every step that they took with tents of
gauze, so as to protect them against the sun
and the wind. Others had screens of pearls
carried before their lady-loves, more beautiful
than the pearls which were intended for
their adornment. It will be seen that our
writers did not lack in metaphors for the
celebration of charming women. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in the right. The flowers of rhetoric are
never better employed than when applied
to those women which the gallantry of our
language has baptized with the name of
flowers.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>SYSTEM OF EDUCATION</i><br />
THE STUDENT</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">When a child in China reaches the
age of five or six years, his parents,
no matter what their position may
be, begin to think about giving him a master,
so that his education may be commenced.
Although instruction is not compulsory in
China, I do not know of any children who
do not go to school. Of course, more or
less time is spent there by the different
scholars, according to their several intelligences
or the position of their parents.</p>

<p>A lucky day at the beginning of the year
is chosen, and on this day the child is sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to some celebrated man of letters to receive
his first lesson, which consists in learning
the three first lines of an elementary book
called San-Tse-King, in which every sentence
consists of three syllables, and which
resumes the history of China and the duties
of man.</p>

<p>This task having been accomplished, the
boy is sent to school, where his real instruction
commences, for the course we have
spoken about is a mere preliminary formality,
undertaken by an honorary professor.
As soon as he has got safely through the
San-Tse-King, the boy passes on to a second
book, called the Tsien-Tse-Weng, a work
which contains one thousand different letters.
At the same time, the scholar has to paint
over in black letters drawn in red in his
copy-book by the schoolmaster. At first the
child is taken on the knees by his master,
who guides his hand, but little by little he
is left to himself. Later on, he is given a
copy to trace through transparent paper,
and so on. A more serious course of instruction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
including the four classical works
of Confucius and of Meng-Tse, and the
five King, or sacred, books, follow this preparatory
course. Whilst these studies are
going on, the professor instructs his scholars
in the poetry of the land. As an exercise,
he gives as a daily task a line of seven
words, the child having to compose a parallel
verse. As an example, heaven, earth,
mountain, water, and so on. When a child
is able to give the parallel of a line of seven
words his intelligence may be considered
to be fairly well developed, as we shall
see.</p>

<p>I remember one day at school the professor
gave us the following theme, which
in Chinese is a line of seven words, and
which was suggested to him by a phenomenon
which he had just witnessed:—</p>

<p>“The flexible body of the bee bends
round a drop of dew on a flower.”</p>

<p>My comrade, whose turn it was to answer,
reflected silently for a long time, until at
last, Providence helping him, he cried out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
seeing before his eyes a scene that was being
enacted in the garden outside—</p>

<p>“The oblique eye of the sparrow stealthily
watches the caterpillar curled up in a
leaf.”</p>

<p>I need hardly say that he was vigorously
applauded by his comrades, and handsomely
rewarded by the professor.</p>

<p>As soon as the books mentioned above
have been done with, besides certain selections
from historical and literary works, the
scholar begins to try his hand at difficult
composition, which is preparatory study for
our general competitive examinations. These
dissertations are composed after the method
of the Bakou, which are the eight rules to be
followed in composition. Subjects are taken
from philosophy or politics, being always
chosen from celebrated classical authors
mentioned above, and especially from Confucius.
Concurrently with these the student
practises his hand at poetical composition,
very difficult tasks being set.</p>

<p>The young candidates have to present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
themselves, in the first place, at the annual
examination, which takes place at the sub-prefecture—this
examination being for the
degree of bachelor of arts. The examination
is a written one. Candidates must, before
attaining this degree, undergo another examination
before an Imperial examiner, specially
commissioned for this purpose. The
examination for the licence, or second degree,
only takes place once every three years, as
does also the examination for the third
degree, which is that of doctor. The two
examinations do not, however, take place in
the same year, or at the same season of the
year. The second examination is held in the
autumn in the different provincial cities, the
third being held at Pekin in the following
spring. It is a very usual thing to see a
young man, who has passed these three examinations
one after the other, return home
in triumph to his parents, who up till then
have been occupying some very humble position;
for in China these competitive examinations
are open to all except such persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
as have followed dishonourable trades. The
family of a common workman, who have had
the good fortune to possess a son who has
passed these examinations, becomes noble <i lang="la">de
jure</i>, and the same honours are paid to the
parents as to the son. In order to understand
to what a degree public sympathy and
encouragement are with a successful candidate,
and the anxiety that every student has
to pass to get his degrees, one must see the
reception given to the successful students.
When the names of the prize-winners are
made public, the official employés come up
in great state, carrying the nominations of the
winners printed on huge pieces of red paper,
which they stick up on the houses of the
lucky ones. They are received with crackers
and squibs, and candles and incense are
burned before the ancestors and the light of
day, in token of gratitude for the distinguished
favour accorded to the candidate. A day is
fixed for the due celebration of the victory,
and all the candidates who have passed are
present at this feast. From early dawn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
families of the successful ones decorate their
houses with flags, and await the arrival of
their friends and neighbours, who come to
bring their congratulations. The candidates
go round in person to pay calls on all their
friends, riding in sedan-chairs, and dressed
in special clothes sent them by their parents-in-law,
or in the case of bachelors, by their
nearest relations. Those who have won the
degree of bachelor wear a blue silk dress, the
licentiates one of darker blue, while the
doctors wear violet silk. A stiff kind of cape,
embroidered in gold and coloured silks, is
worn over the shoulders, and two sprays of
flowers decorate the hat. In front of the
sedan-chair men walk, carrying banners of
red silk attached to bamboos still in leaf,
while the musicians play their most joyful
airs. The auspicious day is called the Day
of the Reception of Flowers. For it appears
that formerly women used to strew flowers
in the paths of the young scholars. The procession
fills many hearts with envy. How
often have I not heard mothers saying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
their children, “Your turn will come some
day if you will only work.”</p>

<p>Success at these examinations opens
every door to the young man, and the
only thing that is feared is non-success.
Once the examination passed, the career
and the fortune of the young man are
assured. The bachelor man of letters will
at once receive offers of marriage from
rich families. This will explain why no
laws of compulsory education are necessary
in a country where, by study, a man may
from one day to another transform the
social position of his family. Ambition
urges people on to secure a good education
for their children. Our students are
sober folk. There is no Latin Quarter for
him to frequent, politics disturb him not,
and the only amusements that he knows
of are poetical competitions and excursions
into the country. His life is one of work
and retirement, but he is never heard to
complain, and has indeed no reason to do
so; for the future smiles upon him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the dusty volumes with which he is surrounded
hold out to him the promise of
what a familiar locution describes as “the
highest honours, the most beautiful women,
and the happiest life.”</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>POETICAL COMPETITIONS</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">In literary circles in China, the
most popular amusement is to
make verses. Instead of shooting,
or playing lawn-tennis, or croquet, or
of indulging in any of the many pleasures
enjoyed in Europe, our literary folk, as
soon as a certain number of them have
a little time to spare, meet together in
turn at each other’s houses, and give themselves
up to poetical tournaments. For, in
China, open receptions, political meetings,
and public lectures are totally unknown,
and the only way that people have of indulging
the fancies of the mind is in the
culture of pure literature. These poetical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
tourneys take place all over China, but it
is especially in the province of Fou-Kien
that they are most common. Thus, when
the late Imperial Commissioner of the
arsenal of Fou-Tcheou, who was also
Viceroy of Nankin, could spare a moment
from his official duties, it was his habit
to call in his subordinates and compose
poetry with them. There are many kinds
of verses, and before the opening of the
contest it is decided what kind of verse
is to be written. A historical or a fancy
subject is set, and each of the competitors
is asked to write a poem of four or eight
lines on this subject. Sometimes two subjects
are given, and these must be treated
in parallel verses of seven syllables each,
each line specially treating one or other of
the two subjects. Another way is to choose
two words, which must appear in a certain
place in two parallel lines of poetry. I
give below some examples, which will help
the reader to understand these rules. As
soon as all the competitors have met, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
vase is passed round. This vase contains,
written on bits of paper which have been
rolled up into balls, words denoting certain
functions connected with the tourney, such
as examiner, copying-clerk, candidate, &amp;c.
Each candidate draws one of the papers,
and thus it is decided who shall compete
and who shall form the committee. Two
examiners and four or eight clerks are
chosen, according to the number of candidates.
One of the examiners then takes up
a book and opens it at hazard. Another
names a number, say nine. The examiner
then reads the ninth line of the page at
which the book is open, and from this line
a phrase, or sentence, or word is selected
to form the subject of the composition.
As soon as the subject has been decided
upon, another vase is placed upon the table,
to which a bell is attached. A thread hangs
from the bell, and at the end of the thread
is a lighted stick of incense. In about half-an-hour
the incense burns out, the thread
catches fire, and, as it snaps, lets fall the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
counterweight of the bell, which rings, and
the lid of the urn falls too. It is then too
late for any more poems to be entered for
examination. The copying-clerks now empty
the vase of the poems, which have been
put into it by the competitors, and copy
them out, all on one and the same piece
of paper, to be submitted to the examiners.
By this means anonymity is strictly protected.
These make a selection, and when
they have decided which of the poems is
the best, one of them gets up in a kind
of desk and sings forth the prize poem.
Each competitor may write as many poems
as he chooses on the subject that has been
set, but has to pay a small fee for each
entry. This money is used for the purchase
of paper, brushes, ink, and the prizes
which are awarded to the winners. As
soon as the prizes have been awarded, a
fresh competition of a different kind is
commenced. The two poets, whose verses
were considered the best in the previous
competition, assume the functions of examiners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
in the second tourney, and this
arrangement continues throughout. In the
evening a dinner brings the fête to an end.
I will now submit some specimens of the
kind of poetry which is written at these
tourneys.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="center">MIDNIGHT.</p>
<p class="center">(<i>Eight-lined Poem.</i>)</p>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The moon shines at midnight</div>
<div class="verse">At the top of the white wall,</div>
<div class="verse">Over which sway the leaves of the bamboo,</div>
<div class="verse">Casting their shadows on the earth;</div>
<div class="verse">Whilst the blinds of the windows remain dark and silent,</div>
<div class="verse">The fire-flys alone gleam in the scented dew.</div>
<div class="verse">Be careful not to walk near the pond,</div>
<div class="verse">For fear of awakening the amorous swans.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="center">THE RETURN OF THE LABOURER.</p>
<p class="center">(<i>Quatrain.</i>)</p>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The mantle of palm fibres and the hat of bamboo leaves are both spotted with water.</div>
<div class="verse">Drops of rain, like very fine threads, fall on the plough.</div>
<div class="verse">It is the best season of the spring.</div>
<div class="verse">The peach-tree blossoms gleam at the corners of the walls, and the cuckoos are singing.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="center">THE BLACK PEONY AND THE WAX TAPER.</p>
<p class="center">(<i>Double Subject for Parallel Verses.</i>)</p>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“His nature is wealthy, so it is a matter of small import to him that he is black.</div>
<div class="verse">His will is bent, how long will he remain red?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is a double play of words here.
The name of peony alludes to the modesty
of its position; the peony is sufficiently
beautiful not to be afflicted thereby. Red
is the aristocratic colour, and, at the same
time, the colour of flame. The taper may
consider himself a very brilliant object; the
time must soon come when its flame must
be extinguished, and it will fall back again
into obscurity and darkness.</p>

<p>Here is another:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="center">THE DRY BAMBOOS AND THE DEATH OF THE SOVEREIGN.</p>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Two sticks planted in the ground as drying poles for the red sleeves.</div>
<div class="verse">A thousand families weep heavenwards, whilst they put on white garments.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dried bamboo stalks are generally used
as drying-poles in China, and are set up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
for this purpose in every courtyard. A
cross-stick holds up the sleeves of the
garments that have been hung out to dry.
Numerous families put on white clothes.
White is the colour of mourning in China.</p>

<p>There is a contrast between the mourning
white and the gay red of women’s garments.</p>

<p>Now, here is a poem of a different kind.
In this the object was to place certain words
in a position designated beforehand. The
words given are “palace” and “battle.” They
have to be placed at the end of each verse:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The names of old servants is familiar to the parrots of the palace.</div>
<div class="verse">The merits of great generals are known to the chargers in battle.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another, where the task was to place the
words “great” and “autumn” at the beginning
of the lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Great snowfall yesterday made me drink up all my wine.</div>
<div class="verse">Autumn rains prevent neighbours, and even the best friends, from calling upon each other.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I have had to recur to inversion, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
have somewhat spoiled the appearance of
these lines to get the words into their right
places. Many people will find these pleasures
of ours very simple, too simple perhaps.
Whatever may be said, they are
preferable to gambling. Besides, Europe,
which also has her simple pleasures, will
not blame us for ours.</p>

<p class="dropcap">China has had its great art epochs,
but for the last few centuries, education
having been a purely literary
one, art seems to have lost ground to a certain
extent. However, it must be admitted,
by those who care to look into the matter,
that all is by no means lost. If we have
not progressed during some centuries past,
and if we have limited ourselves to the reproduction
of certain types which were created
long ago, if, in short, we show no originality,
but only elegance and ease in our artistic
productions, it must, at least, be admitted
that we have scrupulously followed our
ancient traditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Art flourished at its best in China in the
reign of the Thang family. The poet, Tou-Fou,
was an artist also, whilst the painter,
Ouang-Wei, was a poet. Painting could be
found in the poetry of the one, and poetry
in the painting of the other. Although our
old masters did not pay any attention to
the laws of perspective, the works of their
imaginations have always been highly appreciated.
Some of their pictures are exceedingly
rare, and like the two spoken about
in the following poems of Tou-Fou, have
to-day a priceless value:—</p>

<p>This is a somewhat enthusiastic perception
of our old paintings. We have a great
number of amateur painters in China, chiefly
amongst the literary classes, who paint pictures
to give to their friends.</p>

<p>These pictures are precious, because poems
are always written by the side of the paintings.</p>

<p>I remember having seen two celebrated
pictures which would not be parted with at
any price. One represents the open sea, in
the middle of which a fisherman is seen
in his boat, which is covered with snow.
It is accompanied by a poem which fully
equals the <i lang="fr">Pauvres Gens</i> of Victor Hugo.
The other represents a mountain with its
top hidden in clouds. In the middle of the
mountain is a stream which runs down to
its foot, and floating in the water is seen a
cabbage-leaf. The poem that is written on
this picture ends with the following line:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Behind the white cloud there were still people living.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And, sure enough, the cabbage-leaf bespeaks
the presence of man, who alone could
transport cabbage-leaves to the top of a
cloudy mountain.</p>

<p>The allusion is sufficiently concealed; but,
in China, this habit of veiling one’s meaning
is a very common one, and it is specially to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
be noticed in the pictorial art. On the other
hand, such subjects as the following are often
suggested to painters: A red spot in the
midst of green. One painter would paint on
this theme a forest with a stork isolated on
one tree; another would paint a red sunset
in the green sea; another, a woman with red
lips in a bamboo wood.</p>

<p>Artists, in China, never sell their pictures.
They are always amateurs, and give their
pictures away. The only art-wares which
are trafficked in China are produced by
workpeople, and belong to the category of
decorative art. Sculpture is less cultivated
at home by our amateurs, and one must
know our sculptors to understand their ways.
One of them once offered to make my bust.
I went to his house, and he made me sit
down in front of him. We were separated
by a table, which was covered by a cloth
which reached down to the ground. A very
animated conversation began between us.
My friend was a man of a very quick intelligence,
and had a very original turn of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
thought. I was quite taken up with what
he was saying to me, but I still did notice
that he kept his hands under the table, and
this surprised me all the more that I observed
after watching him some time that
he was moving them with feverish activity.
After I had been there about an hour,
which had passed very quickly, thanks to
our gossip, I was just going to rise, when
my friend produced a mass of clay from
beneath the table, and said, “Do you think
that it is like you?”</p>

<p>I was not a little surprised to see that
it was my bust, which, in spite of the
rapidity with which it had been modelled,
was very resembling; a thing which was
very curious, as the artist had never once
looked at the clay, but at my face alone.
He must have had a wonderful skill to be
able to use his fingers both as eyes and
as tools, touch replacing sight.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>CHESS</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">This game differs very much from
the one played in Europe, and
which is the delight of the <i lang="fr">habitués</i>
of the European chess clubs. In our
game there are three hundred and sixty-one
pawns, divided into two camps, one
white and the other black. These pawns
are like round draughts. The game is
played on a square chess-board which has
nineteen squares on each side. The players
set down pawn after pawn, and the one
who succeeds in closing his adversary in,
so that there is no possible issue for him,
wins the game. The skill in this game
consists in closing your adversary in, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in taking as many of his pawns as possible—advancing
wedge-like into his territory,
without losing any of your own forces. It
has been said that this game—the board
of which represented the firmament, the
stars being represented by the three hundred
and sixty-one pawns—was invented
by Emperor Yao, and used by him to instruct
his children and teach them to think.
It is, at the same time, a military game,
representing a battle-field and two hostile
camps, each doing its best to conquer the
other. In short, it is rather a game of
patience, for each game lasts a very long
time, the reflection of a quarter or half-an-hour
being sometimes needed before playing
a pawn. On this account it is called
“game of conversation,” for the player who
is waiting for his adversary to play has
plenty of leisure to talk. It is also known
by another name, that of “meditation in
solitude,” which seems a very good name
for it. It is the favourite pastime of literary
men, ladies, and especially of people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
have retired from business. The noise of
the pawns as they are placed down on the
different squares of the board, which is
often engraved on a marble bench, under
the shade of leafy trees, is considered a
very poetical noise. The three things that
one loves to hear, when one wishes to turn
one’s thoughts towards what is pure and
delicate, are the sounds of water falling,
the wind among the trees, and the rattle
of this game of chess. It has been said
that under the reign of the Tching dynasty
a woodcutter met two young men who
were playing at chess at the top of a
mountain. He watched them, and one of
them gave him a kind of candied fruit
which he swallowed. Before the game had
been finished, he noticed that the handle
of his axe had rotted away. He made
haste back to his village, and could recognise
none of the people he met, for several
centuries had passed away since he had
gone out. History also tells us that a
statesman named Li-No was a very impatient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
man. But once seated at the chess-board
his character completely changed; so
that each time he felt that he was going
to fly into a rage, his friends used to
suggest a game of chess, and at once his
good humour returned to him. One day
the Emperor asked why he wasted at chess
time which might be so much more profitably
employed. He said that the moments
during which a man forgets his worries
are the most precious of all.</p>

<p>I read a very amusing little story in the
“Memoirs of Sou-Toung-Pao.” Emperor
Tai-Tsung used to play chess with one of
his ministers. The sovereign used to give
him three pawns; but the minister always
managed to lose one at the end of each
game. The Emperor, noticing that he
was being allowed to win, said at last, “If
you lose this one more game I shall have
you revoked.” The game was played and
ended in a draw. “One more game,” said
the Emperor. “If you win it I will grant
you the honour of wearing a red robe, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
if you lose it I will have you dragged in
the mud.” The game again ended in a
draw. His Majesty, in a great rage, was
pushing his minister towards the pond to
throw him into the mud, when the minister
cried out, “Softly, softly, your Majesty, I
have got one pawn left over in my hand.”
The sovereign smiled, and gave him the
red robe that he had promised. The game
is usually played in daytime in the summer
and at night in the winter. Do not think
that chess is played on any kind of table.
The game demands a much more poetical
setting, either trees or rocks, or a daintily
furnished drawing-room, with tea and wine
to be served between the games. It is
considered a pleasure to watch the games,
and it is etiquette never to give any advice
to the players. Besides this game of chess
we have another variety, which resembles
the one played in Europe more closely.
It is played on a draught-board which has
nine squares one way and ten the other,
with two sets of pieces, which are arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
in three rows, five pawns in the front row
and behind them two cannons. Three
rows further back is the king, having on
one side and the other two councillors,
two elephants, two horses, and two carriages.
The two camps, which cover each a space
of nine squares, are separated one from the
other by a single row of squares. The rules
of this game are almost the same as in the
European game. The pawns can only
advance straight forward, and on only one
square at a time; the cannons must always
pass over a piece in a straight line; the
carriages go straight ahead; the councillors
go diagonally, and may not leave their
camps; the elephants go straight ahead,
backways or sideways—like the castles in
the European game; the horses are moved
like your knights; and, finally, the chief
is played just like the king in the game
here, and equally when the king is placed
so that he is in check from one of the
pieces of his adversary, without being able
to get away or to take the piece, he is check-mated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and the game is lost. The pieces
are not represented by figures, but have
their designations written on them. Our
industry, so profoundly artistic, has neglected
to occupy itself with this game.
On the other hand, we manufacture figures
of carved ivory for export sets of chess.</p>

THE PLEASURE OF DRINKING</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Wine was first manufactured in
China by a functionary named
I-Ti, under the reign of Emperor
U (22,000 years before Christ), from fermented
rice. The sovereign was the first
to taste this new beverage. He found it
delicious, and said, “I am sure that hereafter
there will be families of kings who will
lose their thrones through drinking wine.”
But his prophecy was never realised in spite
of his prophetic tone, and literary men continue
to indulge themselves in wine to their
heart’s content. There is no party without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
wine, and no wine-party without poetry.
But by no means do we intoxicate ourselves.
I remember that, some years ago, a German
deputy, criticising the law against drunkenness,
pronounced these words:—“If your
law is passed, the people alone will suffer,
for the rich, after getting drunk on champagne
in their private houses, can always
manage to escape the notice of the police,
for, if they have to go out, they can go out
in their carriages.” The law was not passed.
There would be no necessity for such a law
in China, because the people there never get
drunk. Our custom of seeking for happiness
in drinking wine dates from the time of
two celebrated poems, written by Li-Tai-Pe
of the dynasty of the Thang family.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Do you not see that the water of the Yellow River seems to come down from heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">And throws itself into the sea without ever returning to its sources?</div>
<div class="verse">Do you not see also that the mirrors in our drawing-rooms beweep our hairs,</div>
<div class="verse">Which, black this morning, are now already white?</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
<div class="verse">When one is dissatisfied pleasure takes wing;</div>
<div class="verse">The golden jug must not stand there motionless and untouched before the moon.</div>
<div class="verse">Heaven has given us talents to make use of—</div>
<div class="verse">Thus the money that we spend will always return to us.</div>
<div class="verse">Let us slay the sheep, let us roast beef for our pleasure.</div>
<div class="verse">When we meet, we will each empty three hundred glasses.</div>
<div class="verse">You, Master Kien, and you, Ten-Kiou—the literary man—</div>
<div class="verse">Lift your glasses without ceasing.</div>
<div class="verse">I wish to sing to you, and I beg you to listen to me.</div>
<div class="verse">Long since honours have ceased to have any value;</div>
<div class="verse">I would rather be drunk than awake.</div>

<div class="verse">Do not say that you have no money—</div>
<div class="verse">Continue to supply us.</div>
<div class="verse">Take my horse, my fur coat, and go and exchange them for good wine,</div>
<div class="verse">For I intend to forget, in your company, the cares of eternity.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
<div class="verse">The wind brings with it the blossoms of the willow, which scent the whole room;</div>
<div class="verse">And the beautiful lady who invites us to keep on drinking her wine.</div>
<div class="verse">The people of Nan-King are there to bid farewell to their friends,</div>
<div class="verse">Who, having to go, have not yet gone.</div>
<div class="verse">Ask you of the water that flows to the east,</div>
<div class="verse">If it is deeper than is the sorrow of our separation.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another poet of a later date used also to
give himself up to immoderate drinking.
His wife advised him to moderate his passion.
He asked for five jugs as the price of
this sacrifice, and when he had drunk them
he went to sleep. On waking, he asked for
five more jugs of wine, and having emptied
these, he wrote the following quatrain for his
wife:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Heaven has created Liou-Ling,</div>
<div class="verse">Who cannot live without wine;</div>
<div class="verse">And as to the advice given him by his wife,</div>
<div class="verse">He should pay no attention to it.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Grape-wine is unknown in China, and the
only allusion to it that I know of is to be
found in the following lines, which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
written by a warrior who lived in the north
of China, under the reign of the Yang
family:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Grape-wine gleams in the glasses at night—</div>
<div class="verse">I should like to drink but the guitar urges me to go.</div>
<div class="verse">Do not laugh at me if I fall asleep on the field of battle,</div>
<div class="verse">For since ancient times how many warriors have returned from war?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Li-Tai-Pe made an abusive use of wine.
He found friends everywhere, even when he
was alone, for then the moon and his shadow
were his friends. But in spite of that, he
knew how to associate with the pleasure of
drinking the most delicate sentiments and
very lofty philosophical views, as may be
seen in the following poem:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What has become of the towers and the flags of King of Tsou which formerly were accumulated on the tops of hills now deserted?</div>
<div class="verse">When drunkenness elevates me, I lower my paint brush, and my songs shake the five mountains.</div>
<div class="verse">I am glad, and am proud, and I laugh at all greatness.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Power, wealth, honours, before your duration shall be sufficient to merit my esteem.</div>
<div class="verse">The Yellow River will be seen starting from the west to flow towards the north.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Since that time a kind of drinking game
has been invented. A tube, in the shape
of a cylinder, is placed on the table. It
contains a number of ivory rods, each of
which is inscribed with an ancient verse.
Each player draws one of these rods, and
according to the verses on them, it is decided
which player is to drink. Here are
some examples:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Alas! Where is the handsome face to-day?</div>
<div class="verse indent1">(The most bearded player has to drink.)</div>
<div class="verse">In love with a shadow or a sound.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">(It is the shortsighted man’s turn to empty his glass.)</div>
<div class="verse">We see each other without hearing our voices.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">(The deaf man drinks.)</div>
<div class="verse">There is still half the time left for contemplation.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">(The player who wears spectacles drinks.)</div>
<div class="verse">The beaded blinds hide the faces of the roses.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">(The pock-marked player drinks.)</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
<div class="verse">He who is in love with the flowers regrets that they have no voices.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">(The silent man drinks.)</div>
<div class="verse">The cries of modern ghosts mingle with the cries of ancient spectres,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">(The doctor drinks.)”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will be seen that in China the pleasure
of drinking does not lack in those gaieties
with which wine is always accompanied.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>TEA-DRINKING</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">That tea is our favourite drink is
very generally known, but people
may perhaps ignore the considerable
part that it plays in our lives. I will
not speak here either about its cultivation
or the process of its manufacture, which are
pretty well known. I will limit myself to
telling the use that is made of this precious
aromatic plant. Since tea has been known
in China, a part of the first pickings of the
harvest is sent each year to the Emperor
by the authorities in the producing districts.
This is called “The Tea Tribute.” Formerly,
the Court used to distribute tea to the
officials, and the usual presents consisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of tea. Another thing shows the importance
that we attach to this article, and that
is, that we have tea-inspectors, just as we
have salt-superintendents, who are high
functionaries specially commissioned for
the purpose. Instead of cafés, as in Paris,
we have nothing but tea-houses in China,
and these may be seen everywhere. It is
at these tea-houses that people meet to
talk, to rest, and to enjoy the cool air.
When you call on a friend the first thing
that he does is to offer you a cup of tea.
When you write an invitation to a friend
to come and spend some time at your
house, the formula you use is, “The tea
is ready.”</p>

<p>Whilst you are waiting in a shop for
your orders to be executed, the shopman
hands you a cup of tea to help you to be
patient. In the very hot weather, charitable
people in towns always put outside
their doors great urns of tea for thirsty
passers-by to drink from, and these urns
are refilled as soon as they have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
emptied. Those are our public fountains.
There is always tea ready in the workrooms
and other places where workpeople
meet. Tea is the only drink used by the
people. Amongst the highest in the land
there are also numerous tea drinkers. It
is thought that this beverage has the gift
of rendering one’s mind more lucid. It is
always green tea that is drunk in the upper
classes—the little leaves taken from the
bud at its first opening and dried in the
sun. This is our Château-Lafitte. As to
black tea, if is made of leaves which have
reached maturity and have been dried artificially.
This is all the difference that there
is between the two kinds. No artificial
colouring of the leaves is ever resorted to.
Qualities vary, of course, according to the
localities in which the tea is grown, just as
is the case with wine. The best tea is that
grown on a tree which grows in the garden
of a monastery which is situated on the
Ou-I mountain, in the interior of the province
of Fou-Kien. The priests do not sell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
it, but keep it for the use of distinguished
visitors. They give you about ten leaves
in a cup not much bigger than an egg-cup,
and pour on it water taken from an
excellent spring which is situated near the
monastery. The cup is covered for a few
moments to allow the tea to draw. The
scent that rises from the cup when the tea
is ready is most exquisite, and a cup of
this tea not only produces a feeling of
great bodily comfort, but also has a most
exhilarating effect on the mind.</p>

<p>I once amused myself by placing a few
grains of boiled rice in a cup of that tea.
The rice was almost immediately dissolved.
This made me understand how energetic is
the effect of this beverage, its beneficial
action on the human body, and the impossibility
of drinking much of it. Tea is so
essential a factor in Chinese alimentation
that authors like Lu-U have published
whole books on the way of preparing this
drink. These books are our Mrs. Beeton’s.
Tea, as a matter of fact, to be good, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
be made with rain or spring water heated
to a certain degree of heat. The water
should not be allowed to boil more than a
few minutes, and, when bubbles begin to
rise, it should be taken off the fire. The
utensil in which the water is boiled should
be made of certain materials and no others.
True connoisseurs only use pots made of
Ni-Hing, a kind of terra-cotta ware which
is not varnished inside. Thus prepared, the
tea is an economical and healthy beverage.
It is drunk continually and at all hours
of the day, even just before going to bed.
Its effect is never an exciting one. Apropos
of this, one of my compatriots has said that
the Europeans, and specially the English,
do not know how to make tea. In the
first place, they let it boil. Secondly, they
add strong spirits, which destroy its taste;
or sugar, which makes it lose its savour.
Tea should be allowed to infuse for five
minutes at the most, and should be of a
clear colour, barely yellow in hue. The
U-Tchien, or Jade-Spring monastery, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
situated in the province of King-Tiou, in
the midst of rocks and waterfalls, and is
surrounded with tea plantations, which produce
tea-leaves of the size of a man’s hand,
which are called “The Tea of the Hand
of the Immortals.” An octogenarian who
lived in that neighbourhood had the face
of quite a young man, and enjoyed the very
best health, and used to tell anybody who
would listen to him that he owed his good
health and his youthful appearance to the
use of this tea. It is not surprising that
so beneficial a drink should have inspired
the poets. There is an innumerable quantity
of single lines about tea in our literature.
Here are a few specimens of these proverbial
sayings which refer to tea:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To make your friends pass a pleasant evening
the poor man offers them tea.</p>

<p>To make tea with snow is to taste celestial
savours.</p>

<p>When you make tea in the forest, the smoke
drives the storks away.”</p>

</div>

<p>The harvest time varies according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
district. In some parts the harvest is
picked before the rainy season. In others,
it is begun at the sound of the first clap
of thunder; in other parts, the first cry of
the cuckoo is the signal for the pickers to
begin their work. All sorts of stories are
told about our tea, amongst others, that
the tea we export has already been used
and dried again. That is a mere fable.
The tea we export is of average quality,
and is so abundantly to be had that there
is no necessity for us to take recourse to
the disgusting expedients suggested. I may
add that the export trade is almost entirely
in the hands of European business houses.
Besides, all our old tea-leaves are used in
China as sea-weed is used in France for
stuffing mattresses, cushions, and so on.
Thus tea, after having fortified our bodies
during the day, affords us a bed at night.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Although our chopsticks may
have some resemblance to magic
wands, the purpose they fulfil is a
much more prosaic one, and, at the same
time, a much more useful one. They are
the auxiliaries which help us to convey to
our mouths the food which we need for
our bodies, the coal required by the human
machine. It is generally thought in Europe
that we use two chopsticks—one in each
hand—for taking up the morsels of food,
and for conveying these to our mouths.
That is a mistake: our knife and fork
exercise is much less complicated. The
chopsticks are held in the right hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Maintained by the thumb and the ring-finger,
they are worked by the index and
the middle finger. One remains motionless,
the other manœuvres and catches up the
fragments of meat, and even the smallest
particles of rice. When rice is eaten, the
bowl containing it is brought very close to
the mouth. The chopsticks work with
feverish activity, for rice is our daily bread,
and we can admit of no slip between the
cup that contains it and our lips. It may
be thought that the use of the chopsticks
demands very great skill, but that is only
the prejudice of those accustomed to the
use of the fork. A child can learn how to
use the chopsticks as easily as the utensils
in use in Europe. It may be mentioned
that we also make use of forks for roast
meats, and of spoons for taking up liquids.
The Book of Rites, which deals with all
the acts of life, mentions that chopsticks
are to be used for all purposes except for
drinking soup. The use of the spoon was
thus consecrated many centuries ago. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
chopsticks are not plain, shapeless pieces
of wood. They are made of bamboo, or
of more precious woods, and also of ivory
and silver. The top part, which is from
eight to ten inches long, by from four to
six broad, is square, the remaining part
being round. On one of the sides of the
square top part, poems and pictures are
engraved. Under the reign of the Han
family, the Emperor was dining one day at
a political banquet with his ministers, when
one of them—Tcheng-Liang by name—rose
to his feet and said: “Your majesty’s cause
is lost. I have just consulted my chopsticks.”
And as it turned out, the Emperor’s plan
of conquest failed. Even to-day the cleverness
of this statesman, who knew how to
disguise his own opinion in the form of
a revelation by his chopsticks, and to pass
off his own advice as the result of a Divine
inspiration, is much admired.</p>

<p>Some centuries later, the famous dictator,
Tchao-Tsao, was dining with a rival of his,
who tried to hide his ambition under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
most modest appearance. Tchao-Tsao was
anxious to publicly expose the designs of his
rival, whom he had seen through, and began
to talk of the bravest men of the day. Each
mentioned certain names, and finally Tchao-Tsao
said, “We two alone are really courageous
men.” Hearing himself thus directly
named, Liou-Pei, as the rival was called,
dropped his chopsticks just as a clap of
thunder was heard rolling through the sky.
He tried to hide his emotion, and said,
“Ah! how great is the power of heaven, I
really was frightened.” But he was unable
to divert the suspicion to which his terror
had given rise.</p>

<p>Under the reign of the Thangs, Kai-Yang
presented a pair of gold chopsticks to his
Minister of State, Soung-King, saying that
he made him this present, not on account
of the intrinsic value of the gold, but because
the chopsticks were symbolical by their shape
of the straightforwardness of his character.</p>

<p>It is recorded of a gourmet, named Ho-Tseng,
who used to spend a large sum of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
money on his food, without ever being able
to satisfy his tastes, that he fed like a prince,
and though he spent upwards of a thousand
crowns on his table, did not consider a single
dish worthy of his chopsticks.</p>

<p>The number of historical anecdotes told
about chopsticks is far too large to be given
here. Let me, however, quote one of these
anecdotes;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A sea-shell which had the elongated form of a
stick, and which is known as the solen or razor, is
greatly appreciated in China. It bears a mark on
its side. It is said that an Emperor having taken
a solen up in his chopsticks, cast it into the lake.
The mollusc multiplied, but each of its descendants
preserve the traces of the chopsticks of Emperor
Han-Ou-Ti.”</p>

</div>

<p>Let me conclude with four lines of poetry
about the chopsticks, which were written by
one of our philosophers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I often wish to consult my chopsticks,</div>
<div class="verse">Which always taste what is bitter and what is sweet before we do.</div>
<div class="verse">But they answer that all good savour comes from the dishes themselves,</div>
<div class="verse">And that all that they do is to come and to go.”</div>

<span class="smaller"><i>CHINESE COOKING</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">So many dreadful things have been
said about Chinese cooking, that I
think it indispensable to devote a
chapter to the rehabilitation of our culinary
art. I do not pretend to make your mouths
water, but I should like at least to be able
to show you that my countrymen do not eat
the extraordinary things attributed to them
by certain prejudiced travellers. Our ordinary
meal consists of eight dishes—two
vegetables, eggs, a fish, some shell-fish, a
bird, two dishes of meat, pork and goat in
the south, and mutton and beef in the north.
Besides this, a large tureen of soup is served
with the rice, which takes the place of bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
at our tables, and is our substitute for wine
and tea, which are only served on very
great occasions at meal times. Food being
extremely cheap, the cost of three daily
meals, similar to the one described, never
exceeds fivepence per person. A pound of
meat costs only twopence halfpenny, or threepence,
whilst the price of a good fowl is
sixpence, or, at the most, sevenpence.</p>

<p>In 1882, I embarked on board a Chinese
ship at Hong-Kong, on my way home. Not
being able to accommodate myself with the
fare on board, I told a servant that I should
like a chicken for lunch, and gave him a
dollar to buy it with, this sum representing
the usual cost of a chicken in France. A
minute or two later he came to ask me how
he was to prepare it. “Cut it up and stew
it in its juice,” I said, “and season well.”
Shortly afterwards he brought me a huge
trencher, resembling a tub, filled with a
fricassee of little pieces of smoking chicken.</p>

<p>“What! All that?” I cried.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. With your dollar I got twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
chickens, and have cooked them as you told
me to do.”</p>

<p>At the sight of this quantity of meat, and
of the pantagruelic dish in which they were
served, my appetite disappeared, and I made
him carry the dish away, and distribute it
among the servants in the kitchen. I mention
this to show how little provisions cost at
home. A workman earning one franc, or
tenpence a day can keep a wife and two
children in comfort, and still put by half his
earnings.</p>

<p>When I was at the military school, where
the cadets mess like officers, all I had to pay
for my food was fourpence a day, and was
so well fed for this money that I never had
any cause for complaint. It is easy to
understand the reason why things are so
cheap in China. There are no taxes at
home on articles of food. According to
statistics, each inhabitant of the Empire
pays two francs, or eighteenpence, in taxes
per annum, but no part of this sum represents
any tax on food. Europeans who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
complain that they spend far too much
money in China have only themselves to
blame. I have never heard of any European
who cared to live as we live. Parisian
dishes, already very expensive in this country,
are naturally trebly so in China, in spite of
the fact that raw materials cost so little.
Besides, the cuisine of each country depends
on its climate. Since I have been in France
I have accustomed myself to French cookery,
reputed the best of all. Whenever I return
to China, and am invited to dinner by
French people, I get quite upset, and often
feel quite ill after dinner. Coffee irritates
my stomach, and cigars make my nose
bleed. Now, when I am in Europe I
cannot do without my coffee and my cigar
after dinner. It is not surprising, then, that
Europeans cannot enjoy life in China, persisting
as they do in eating only what suited
them at home. When a friend calls on you
in China to take pot-luck with you, you
usually ask him to a restaurant, and order a
dinner in his honour. These dinners usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
cost six dollars, that is to say, twenty-four
shillings for eight persons. The dinner is a
very complete meal, as may be judged by
the following bill of fare:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Four plates of <i lang="fr">hors d’œuvres</i>.</p>

<p>Four plates of dried fruits.</p>

<p>Four plates of fresh fruit, according to the
season.</p>

<p>Four large dishes—a whole duck, sharks’ fins,
swallows’ nests, and some kind of meat.</p>

<p>Four middle-sized dishes—poultry, shell-fish,
and meat.</p>

<p>Four small dishes or bowls, containing mushrooms,
morels, which we call ears of the
forest, rice of the immortals, which is the
name we give to a kind of mushroom, and
the tender sprouts of the bamboo.</p>

<p>Four large dishes, containing fish, sea-stars,
and mutton.</p>

</div>

<p>These last four dishes finish the repast.
As a rule, nobody touches them, and their
appearance on the table is the signal for
rising. The price of ceremonial dinners
rarely exceeds twenty dollars, or four
pounds, for eight persons. The list of
dishes is a much larger one, and includes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
two roasts, which are served at the middle
of the dinner, together with little pieces of
bread cooked in the <i lang="fr">bain-marie</i>.</p>

<p>A servant, armed with a very sharp carving-knife,
removes the skin of the roast, be it wild
duck, goose, or sucking pig, and serves each
guest with a little in a saucer. At the same
time, another servant hands each guest a small
cup, into which he pours rice brandy. I forgot
to say that the table is cleared before
the roasts are served, just as in Paris before
coffee is brought on to table. Pastry is
always served at our dinners, and is brought
on between the courses. With salt pastry,
containing meat, a cup of chicken broth is
served, whilst with sweet pastry almond milk
is handed round. I must add that dinner
always begins with <i lang="fr">hors d’œuvres</i> including
fruit, and ends with a bowl of rice, which may
be eaten or not, according to the tastes of the
guests. Tea is served immediately after
dinner, and at the same time each guest
receives a napkin dipped in hot water.</p>

<p>The diners sit at a square table, two on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
each side. The first and third face the second
and fourth, the sixth and the fifth face the
courtyard, to which the seventh and eighth
turn their backs. The eighth is always the
master of the house, whose special function it
is to fill the glasses of his guests with wine.
When there are more than eight, several
tables are used. If four tables are needed,
the third and fourth are near the courtyard,
whilst the first and second are near the
drawing-room. <i lang="fr">Hors d’œuvres</i> include, besides
fruit, ham, gizzards, grated meat grilled,
dried shrimps, and preserved eggs. The
latter, thanks to their coating of lime, will
keep for an indefinite period; after twenty-five
years they are exquisite to the taste,
having undergone a kind of transformation,
the result of which is that the yellows have
become a kind of dark brown in colour, and
the whites, also brown, resemble meat jelly.
I once made some European friends of mine
taste some of these eggs, as well as other
Chinese dishes, and they were delighted with
them, all prejudice apart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Once, however, a Berlin lady, after having
found that our cooking was delicious, asked
the name of each of the dishes of one of our
interpreters, who, not knowing the exact
translation of the technical expression, “sea-slug,”
answered that the dish in question was
“sea hedgehog,” or See-Igel in German.
This was enough to disgust our amiable
guest, who refused to continue her dinner.
I was sitting next to her, and she told me
that she could feel it crawling in her throat
still, which shows how great is the force of
imagination. Marquis d’Hervey de Saint-Denys
gave a Chinese dinner during the
Exhibition of 1867, and Cham, the famous
caricaturist, drew the menu. There were
some abominable things in this bill of fare,
and the faces of the guests after they had
glanced at it was a sight to be seen. It took
the marquis all his eloquence to reassure
them. I will not deny that there are people
in China who eat these extraordinary dishes,
but these are the exceptions to the rule. I
repeat here, that never in my life have I seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
or heard of any one who ate cat or dog, a
practice which only quite recently a writer
in the <cite>Figaro</cite> accused us of. Apropos of
this, I must relate a very curious thing that
befell us, when, in the spring of 1878, our
Legation first settled in Paris. One day I
received a call from a footman in livery, who
desired to speak to me in the name of his
mistress, a Polish countess of very high
position. This lady had amongst her pets
twelve little Chinese dogs, those hairless little
bow-wows that everybody has seen. She
loved them dearly, and, being frightened lest
the Chinese colony might eat up her darlings,
sent me word, considering us apparently as
wild beasts or savages, to the effect that if
one of her pets should disappear she would
set fire to the Embassy building. I reassured
the good old lady, and sent her
word that none of my countrymen had an
appetite for dog-meat, and that should she
miss one of her pets one day it would be
much wiser on her part, before committing
the crime of arson with premeditation, to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
round to the police-station or to the dogs’
home.</p>

<p>In short, we eat very much as you do, with
rather more variety, thanks to the productiveness
of our country and of our sea. But
never are disgusting or even curious dishes
seen on our tables. It is true that we prepare
our dishes in a different manner. For instance,
we cut the food up into very little
pieces, in consequence of which the nature of
the dish is not to be recognised, but our dishes
are none the less delicious on that account.
I could call in witness of what I assert all
Europeans who have lived in China.</p>

<p>Cooking, moreover, is in exact ratio to the
state of civilisation of each nation—the more
developed the one, the more <i lang="fr">recherché</i> and the
more perfect the other. France is the country
in Europe which was civilised the first, and its
cuisine is the most perfect in the West. So,
instead of asking us whether we are in the
habit of preparing such and such a fantastic
dish, the European would do better to ask
from what year our civilisation dates. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
answer to this question would at once show
him that it is absurd to attribute to us the
consumption of disgusting dishes, and that
this is the work of mere imagination, vivid
perhaps, but completely in the wrong.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>GAMES OF SKILL</i><br />
CONJURING</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">There are no theatres in China,
like the Egyptian Hall in London,
that is to say, conjuring theatres.
The conjurer has to perform in public, in
the squares, and places like his European
brethren at the different fairs. Conjurers
are often hired to perform at family parties,
and never fail to win great applause. The
Chinese conjurer is, at the same time, an
acrobat, and knows both his trades very
well indeed. The proverbial skill of our
artists is really astonishing. The performance
is generally opened with acrobatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
feats, and after having swallowed
swords, juggled with weights, and gone
through exercises of this description, the
acrobat transforms himself into a magician.
He throws off his gown, and as it falls to
the earth, asks the spectators what object
they would like to see. Something very
difficult to produce is naturally chosen, and
the sorcerer begins to make strange gestures
with his fingers. He then approaches the
gown, mutters some mysterious word of
command to it, mesmerises it with strange
mesmeric passes, and suddenly the gown
is seen to rise from the earth, and rises and
rises until the master, drawing back this
moving curtain, discloses beneath it smoking
dishes, or a large bowl filled with water,
in which quantities of gold and silver fish
are disporting themselves. This is one of
the tricks that I have seen performed, and
have never been able to understand how
it was done. But one of my friends told
me of something that he had seen which
was much more astonishing. One day, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the course of one of these performances, the
conjurer asked his audience to name what
they desired to see. One of the spectators
asked for a pumpkin. The conjurer, at
first, pretended that that was out of the
question, as it was not in season. But, the
public insisting, he gave way. He then
took a pumpkin seed and planted it in the
earth, and made his son—a lad of four or
five years—lie down, and thrust his knife
into his throat, as if he had been slaughtering
an animal. The blood poured out into
a pot, and when it had been collected the
conjurer watered with it the spot where
he had just planted the seed. He then
covered the corpse up with a cloth, and
placed a wooden bell over the seed. A
few moments later a sprout was seen rising
from the soil, which grew and grew and
burst into flower. The flower fell, and the
pumpkin showed itself, growing with extraordinary
rapidity. When it was ripe, the
magician picked it off its stalk, showed it
to the public, and began making his collection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
He then lifted up the cloth from his
son, and instead of disclosing a corpse,
brought to light a very healthy youth, who
did not bear the vestige of a wound. All
this was done with surprising neatness.</p>

<p>Another of my friends told me, on his
return from Pekin, that he had seen still
more extraordinary things. One day, after
the literary examinations, the candidates
clubbed together and sent for a troupe of
conjurers. The chief, having shown certain
tricks, asked if the audience would like to
see some rare thing that they might choose.
“A peach,” cried one of the spectators. It
was then the month of March, when the
land is still ice-bound, especially in the north
of China. “A peach!” said the conjurer;
“that is the only fruit that it is impossible
for me to procure. At this time of the year,
peaches can only be found in Paradise.”</p>

<p>“But as you are a magician,” was the
answer, “you ought to be able to bring one
down from heaven.”</p>

<p>After grumbling a good deal, the conjurer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
said he would try what he could do for them,
and began weaving a roll of ribbon, which
he cast into the air, and which took the
shape of a ladder, which went up and up to
a tremendous height. He then placed a
child on this ladder, who ran up the rungs
with the agility of a monkey, and was soon
lost to sight in the clouds. Some moments
passed, when suddenly a peach fell from the
skies. The magician picked it up, cut it
into slices, and offered it to the audience.
It was a real peach. Hardly had the peach
been eaten, when something else fell from
the skies. Horror! It was the head of
the child, which was speedily followed by
the trunk and the limbs. The sorcerer
picked them up with tears in his eyes, and
said that the audience was to blame for the
loss of his child by its absurd request, and
that the guardians of Paradise had taken his
child for a thief, and had cut him into pieces.
The spectators, touched at the sight of his
sorrow, and believing that they were really
to blame for a murder, and wanting to do all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
in their power to comfort the unhappy father,
made a collection, and presented him with a
handsome sum of money. Meanwhile, the
magician had placed the fragments of his
son’s corpse in a box, which he always
carried round with him. As soon as he
had received the amount of the subscription,
he opened the box and cried out—</p>

<p>“Come forth, my child, and thank these
kind gentlemen.” And out sprang the youth,
alive and well.</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter, I must tell a
story about a ventriloquist. It was at a
dinner given by a gentleman, who, as a rule,
was very unhappy in life, and bored himself
dreadfully when alone. He used to say that
when he had no friends to talk to, the softest
carpets appeared to him like bundles of
needles, and the most beautifully decorated
walls like bucklers. He used to write poems
to kill time. When people knocked at his
door he used to ask them to stay to dinner,
whether he knew their names or not. That
day not one of the guests who sat at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
table knew any of the others. The conversation
turned on the question, which sound
was the most agreeable. One of the spectators
said, “It is the sound of the shuttle as
it flies across the loom, or the voice of a
reading child.”</p>

<p>“No, no; that is too serious,” said the
host.</p>

<p>“Then it is the neighing of horses, or the
concert of lady musicians.”</p>

<p>“No; that is too noisy,” said the host.</p>

<p>“The rattle of the pawns at chess played
by women.”</p>

<p>“Nor that. That is too monotonous.”</p>

<p>The fourth guest said nothing, but continued
quietly emptying his glass.</p>

<p>“What is your opinion?” asked the others.</p>

<p>“I have no opinion to give,” said he;
“but I should like to tell you about the
sounds I heard in Pekin. They seem to
me to be much superior to any others.
They were the different noises emitted by
a ventriloquist. He was seated behind a
screen, where there was only a chair, a table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and a fan, and a ruler. He rapped the
ruler on the table to enforce silence, and,
when everybody had ceased speaking, there
was suddenly heard the barking of a dog;
then the movements of a woman, waked
by the noisy brute, who shook her husband
to say tender things to him. We were just
expecting to hear a duet of love between
the two spouses when the noise of a crying
child was heard. Then we heard the mother
giving the breast to the baby, and the sound
of it drinking and crying at the same time.
The mother tried to console it, and then
rose to change its clothes. Meanwhile,
another child, waking in its bed, began to
make a noise; its father scolded it, whilst
the younger child continued crying at its
mother’s breast. Then the whole family go
back to bed and fall asleep. The patter of
a mouse is heard. It climbs up some vase
and upsets it, and we hear the clatter as
it falls. The woman coughs in her sleep.
Cries of ‘Fire, fire,’ are heard. The mouse
has upset the lamp, and set fire to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
bed-curtains. The husband and the wife,
wakened, begin to shout and scream, the
children cry, thousands of people come
running up, and vociferate; thousands of
children cry, dogs bark, the walls come
crashing down, squibs and crackers explode—it
seems a general <i lang="fr">sauve-qui-peut</i>.
The fire-brigade comes racing up; water is
pumped up in torrents, and hisses in the
flames. It was all so true to life that all
present were about to rise to their feet
and run away, thinking that fire really had
broken out, when a second blow of the ruler
was struck on the table, and the most complete
silence ensued. We rushed behind
the screen, but there was nothing except
the ventriloquist, his table, his chair, and
his ruler.”</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>THE EVOCATION OF SPIRITS</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A number of people believe in
spirits, and make it a pleasure to
summon them into their presence
by way of pastime. A cylindrical box, containing
a number of little sticks, each of
which bears a number, may be seen in every
temple, and before the altars of every god.
When a man wants to know his future, he
first of all burns candles and incense before
the god; then he kneels down at the altar,
holding one of these boxes in his hands. He
then asks the question that he wants to have
answered, and shakes the box gently until
one of the little sticks fall out. This he picks
up, and places it before the god; then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
takes two hemispheres, and throws them to
the ground. If they fall on the flat side, that
means that the little stick is the right one; but
if on the convex side, that means that the
stick is no good, and the thing must begin
over again. If the stick has been recognised
to be right, it is taken to the guardian of the
temple, who gives a number corresponding
to the one printed on it. This number has
written on it a motto such as you see in
crackers in Europe, and it is according to
this motto that the future is read. Sometimes
most extraordinary results are obtained
by this means; at other times, however, the
answer has no sense or portent.</p>

<p>Sometimes a plate is taken, and a piece of
paper carefully wetted is applied to it. A
Taoist priest is called, who begins by making
mysterious gestures over the dish, and then
rubs the paper on it with a piece of paper
tightly rolled up. This rubbing produces a
quantity of figures and scenes, and from these
figures and scenes the future is predicted.
Supposing a theft has been committed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
plate will show the scene of the theft, with
the portrait of the thief. A cheap and easy
way of detecting crime, it must be admitted.
More than that, it shows what punishment
will befall the guilty man. If a needle is
taken and the eyes of the portrait of the thief
in the dish be struck with it, the real offender
instantaneously becomes blind.</p>

<p>We have also a number of inspired hypnotic
mediums and lucid somnambulists. They go
to sleep, the spirit moves them, they rise up
and predict what is going to happen, or cure
the sick. They can be pricked with pins
without feeling any pain, and can walk on
burning coals without burning themselves.</p>

<p>We have no want of literary gods. A large
dish is taken filled with sand, and then the two
ends of a carved stick of wood are moved over
it. The god guides the points, and a number
of acrostic sentences and poems are the result,
written in the sand. The spirits of well-known
literary men of bygone ages are called
for, and they are begged to attend the meeting,
and to give some specimens of their poetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
talents. Let me describe one of these
scenes.</p>

<p>The brush, after having moved about for
some time, announces that a literary god is
approaching. At once it begins to trace out
the following quatrain:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Twilight covers half the mountains,</div>
<div class="verse">The tired birds return to their nests.</div>
<div class="verse">The stork, driven by the azure zephyr,</div>
<div class="verse">Comes down from heaven through the clouds.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next a goddess presents herself and writes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The distant mountains are seen against the sunset, now bright, now pale;</div>
<div class="verse">A sound of bells seem to wish to pierce the aurora borealis.</div>
<div class="verse">My existence resembles the light cloud which in one moment crosses a thousand hills,</div>
<div class="verse">Which permits me to contemplate the ten thousand mountains in one moment.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The goddess asked at the same time that
all those present should submit their poems,
that she might applaud or condemn them.
Each man gave a poem, which was immediately
burned, so that it might reach in
wraith the goddess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly the friend of the goddess put in
her appearance, or rather manifested herself.
Her name was Siao-Ling, which means
Young Lotus. This is what she wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Yesterday evening the brilliant snow and the icy wind cut like scissors.</div>
<div class="verse">I opened my door to contemplate the distant view.</div>
<div class="verse">I noticed that my plum-tree had added to its blossoms.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We then asked her if at that time of the
year they were very busy in heaven.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered; “all our days are
like each other. It is only on New Year’s
Day that there is a great reception at the
house of our Sovereign Master.”</p>

<p>“Do the gods keep Lenten fasts?”</p>

<p>“Our Master before becoming a genii used
to abstain from rice. Once immortal, he
gave up food of all kinds. As regards the
food of the gods, it is composed of venison,
of dragons’ livers, of mountain flowers, and
fruits of Paradise, and so on.”</p>

<p>“Is it true that besides heaven there is
hell?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hell and heaven are in the minds of
men—one represents what is good, the other
what is bad.”</p>

<p>This exchange of questions and answers
went off as easily as a conversation between
friends. The answers were given much
more quickly than at table-turning seances.
Our amusing game lasted until long past
midnight.</p>

<p>The above is a very accurate description
of this kind of spirit seance, as generally
practised in China. Of course, in different
places the language and the way of thinking
differs. It is because of the elevated style
of the language used at these meetings that
they enjoy so much favour with our literary
men.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>PHRENOLOGY AND CHIROMANCY</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">In no country, so much as in China,
has the belief in phrenologists and
chiromancists been so general. According
to these men of science, every mark
on the face and body has its meaning. In
consequence, as such and such a sign, say, on
your left eye, may be counter-balanced by
some other sign, say, on your right cheek, it
will be seen that a whole series of combinations
and calculations has to be gone through
before the definite diagnosis of a person can
be obtained. When one goes to consult
these oracles, they first of all examine your
face, then the hands, and then the body,
just as a doctor who wishes to thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
examine a patient. After that they ask you
to walk with your usual step, which is
another factor in the combination. According
to their lore, the various acts of life have
significance—thus, slow eating, quick digestion,
heavy sleep, and laziness in dressing
are all very bad signs. A dark forehead
means mourning for a near relation. A long
face on a short body indicates a man of a
calm and quiet life. A head short set in
shoulders and a fat round stomach betoken
a vile man. Long ears with the lobes ball-shaped
are sure signs of a statesman. Large
ears bent forward show that their owner
leads an agitated and fatiguing existence.
The famous Lao-Tse, the founder of the
Taoist religion, had ears seven inches long.
Thick and bushy eyebrows mean that their
possessor will be rich in brothers and sisters.
Each break in them means the loss of one
brother, and the nearer the break is to the
outer end, the younger that brother will be.
When the eyebrows are longer than the
eyes, that means that you have a literary man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
before you. A spot at the side of the eye
means that the person will have tears to
shed. The nose should be large and thick.
It is then the “Spring of the Mountain,”
the “Devil’s Well,” the “Lake of the
Genii,” or the “Tower of the Soul.” The
nose is considered the principal feature,
because many of our sovereigns had very
large noses, and notably Emperors Fou-Hi-U
and Han-Kao-Tsou. The latter was further
endowed with a thick, black beard, and
besides having the face of a dragon, had
seventy-two black birth marks below his
hip. Another emperor, Weng-Ouang, who
lived at an earlier date, had four breasts. It
will be seen that teratology plays its part in
China. To all these persons, as to Lao-Tse,
the high places that they afterwards occupied
were foretold. When the beard is bristly,
the wearer is a sly man. A long beard is
the sign of a long life. A brown beard betokens
a general. A Buddhist high-priest,
whose beard reached down to his knees, had
his lofty position predicted on that account.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
A big mouth will always have food. A black
spot at the corner of the mouth promises
good cheer for ever. A sly and deceitful
man has thin and pinched lips. Red lips
betoken good birth. White and equal
teeth are signs of aristocratic connections.
Hard teeth foretell premature old age.
A soft tongue is the tongue of an orator.
A rough voice, like that of a wolf, and
waspish eyes belong to pitiless and unfeeling
people.</p>

<p>A number of tokens are to be read in the
hand. The observations of our chiromancists
being almost identical with those of
their European confrères, I will therefore
not enter into these details, but will break
the monotony of this description with a few
anecdotes.</p>

<p>A literary man, named Tao-Kan, had a
line of happiness which went in a perfect
straight line from the wrist to the middle of
the first joint of the middle finger. He was
told that, if this line lengthened out any
more, he might expect the highest honours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
He contented himself with pricking the
extremity of this line with a needle, and
writing the word “duke” with the blood;
and as it happened he was created a
duke.</p>

<p>Another, named Li-Kou, one day consulted
a phrenologist, who pointed out to
him that his temple-bones were very pronounced,
and that they reached out to
behind his head, and that, in consequence,
he would be raised to a place of honour.
This prophecy was duly realised.</p>

<p>A prefect of Ho-Nan, named Tcheou,
met a phrenologist, who spoke to him as
follows:—In three years you will be
appointed minister and generalissimo, and
one year later you will die of hunger. The
prefect laughed, and said, that once in so
high a position, he could not starve. But
the phrenologist insisted that such was his
destiny, and that he could not escape, basing
his assertion on the fact that the little veins
which usually flow vertically towards the
mouth, had a horizontal position in his face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
All that had been predicted happened.
After having risen to be a minister and
commander-in-chief, the former prefect had
to retire in disgrace, and died of a disease
which prevented him from taking any
food.</p>

<p>Duke Ouang-King-Tche, whose mother
was a phrenologist, was born in a violet
caul. When he was a little older, two
long breasts grew under his arms. The
mother announced a brilliant future for
her son, and events proved that she was
right.</p>

<p>It had been predicted to the mother of
Empress Wou-Hao, of the dynasty of the
Thang family, that she would have a child
who would reign on the throne. As she
was a simple middle-class woman, she did
not place much faith in this piece of news.
She had a daughter which she showed to a
phrenologist, and told him that it was a
boy. He made the child walk, and said,
“If it be a boy, it will one day become
emperor.” As a matter of fact the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
became empress, and after the death of her
husband mounted on the throne. She was
one of the two empresses who have reigned
over China.</p>

<p>An emperor, of the dynasty of the Tchings,
had no children. He sent for a phrenologist,
and asked him to tell him which of the ladies
in the palace could make him a father. The
phrenologist pointed out one, but added that
after having given birth to a child she would
be devoured by a tiger. The young woman
in due time presented the emperor with a
son. This point having been realised, the
second prediction was thought about. Nobody
had seen any tiger, and nobody thought
that the prediction could be realised. The
picture of a tiger was sent for, so that
people might see what kind of an animal it
was that was to prove fatal to the empress,
and the young woman, wishing to destroy
her enemy, struck the picture with so much
force that she wounded herself, and died of
gangrene in the arm.</p>

<p>A man aged thirty years had already lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
two of his brothers. His mother, fearing
for his life, also went to a phrenologist, and
asked if her last child was not also threatened
with the same fate that had befallen his
brothers. The phrenologist said that in
order to answer he must pass one night with
the young man. During his sleep he listened
attentively to the breathing of the sleeper,
and noticed that his breath seemed to come
out of his ears. The phrenologist then
comforted the mother, and said, “Your son
will live long and happy, for he breathes
like a tortoise.”</p>

<p>There are, of course, numbers of quacks
in the profession. The following is a story
about one of them. It is rather amusing:—</p>

<p>The Governor of a province once sent for a
phrenologist, and asked him to select amongst
a number of ladies, who were all dressed
in the same way, which was his wife. The
phrenologist looked at them for a long time
without being able to answer. At last he
cried out, “It is she out of whose forehead a
yellow cloud has just issued forth.” Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
course everybody turned round to look at
the real lady, and the phrenologist equally,
of course, guessed at once which was the
Governor’s wife, and pointed her out with
the most prophetic of gestures.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>DIFFERENT GAMES</i></span></h2>

<h3>ORIENTAL SHOOTING MATCHES</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">These matches were played with
little rods, which the players had
to throw into a long-necked and
narrow-mouthed vase.</p>

<p>According to the Book of Rites, the host at
a dinner party had to offer these arrows to his
guests, and it was their duty to refuse them
at first, but after some pressing to accept
them. A servant then brought a vase on to
the table, and the guests threw each two or
four arrows into its mouth. At rich dinner-parties
each arrow that entered the vase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
was saluted with a burst of music from the
orchestra. A horse or a carriage was given
to the player who succeeded in putting all
his arrows into the vase.</p>

<p>Our forefathers asserted that the character
of a man could easily be told by his manner
of playing this game. Suspicious and timid
people threw their arrows for the most part
askance, whilst weak-minded men invariably
missed the mark. To succeed once and to
miss twice was a sign of a want of perseverance,
for to get the arrow exactly into the
mouth of the vase a sharp eye and a good
aim are necessary, and it will not do to do
too much or too little. The throw must
also be straight, and the aim exactly at the
centre, and this, in conformity with human
principles about straightforwardness and
moderation, our forefathers used also to think
that the activity put into play at this game
resembled that of the conscience. To miss
one’s aim with an arrow was equivalent to
neglecting a duty. The rule was to reflect
with prudence, and to throw with measure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
He who did this was fitted to become an
able statesman.</p>

<p>One wins without manifesting pride or
showing his delight, another cheats or
tries to draw too near the mark. These
different ways of acting enable one to
distinguish between honest and dishonest
people.</p>

<p>To conclude, men used thus to be judged
formerly by trifles of small importance in
themselves, but which became powerful
auxiliaries of truth. And it was for that
reason that our ancestors included this game
in their rituals.</p>

<h3>THE CANDLESTICK</h3>

<p>This game is also a very ancient one,
and consists in getting a person to guess
what object is hidden under a bell of
non-transparent material, metal or china.
Those who guess must not name the object
directly, but must compose a quatrain referring
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>For instance, supposing a lizard has been
hidden, this is how a clever player would tell
us that he had guessed it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“It is not a dragon, for it has no horns;</div>
<div class="verse">It is not a serpent, for it has feet;</div>
<div class="verse">It can divide itself, and it can climb up walls.</div>
<div class="verse">It is a lizard.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One day three objects were hidden under
the bell—a swallow’s egg, a piece of honeycomb,
and a spider. The following were the
quatrains which revealed the nature of the
hidden objects:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The first is one of the beloved of spring, who climbs on the roofs of the drawing-rooms.</div>
<div class="verse">When the male or the female is fledged,</div>
<div class="verse">It at once spreads out its wings.</div>
<div class="verse">It is a swallow’s egg.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The second is a house hung upside down.</div>
<div class="verse">It has a multitude of doors and windows.</div>
<div class="verse">The sweetest fluid is stored up in it.</div>
<div class="verse">And its inhabitants multiply in it.</div>
<div class="verse">It is a honeycomb.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The third resembles a long-footed slug.</div>
<div class="verse">It produces threads for making nets,</div>
<div class="verse">Into which all falls for its nourishment.</div>
<div class="verse">It is night which makes it happy.</div>
<div class="verse">It is a spider.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other guessers were still more skilful, albeit
they did not compose quatrains.</p>

<p>A Sovereign had placed a white bird under
a bell, and ordered his Minister to guess. He
answered that the emperor could not force
him to guess. When he was asked why not,
he said, “Let him, first of all, let his white
bird escape.”</p>

<p>On another occasion a rat was hidden.
Everybody said it was a rat. But one very
clever player insisted that there were four
rats under the bell. The bell was removed,
and it was found that, true enough, there
were four rats. Whilst she had been in confinement,
the rat had given birth to three
little ones.</p>

<p>Guessing is done by means of the Koua,
or diagrams, of which I have spoken elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<h3>SHUTTLECOCKS</h3>

<p>We also play with shuttlecocks, made of
four duck feathers, the ends of which are
passed through the square hole in the centre
of one of our coins and bent down, which
renders them very elastic. Ladies play with
battledores; gentlemen use their feet, as in
the English game of football. A certain
height is fixed upon, and the player who
fails to reach it loses the game. The same
game is played with leather balls stuffed
with cotton.</p>

<h3>THE COIN GAME</h3>

<p>A coin is thrown against the wall. The
player whose coin springs back farthest from
the wall begins. He throws his coin in any
direction, and it is agreed upon that the
other players must throw their coins so as to
fall at such or such a distance from the place
where his is lying. Those who manage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
do this, or get closest to the mark, win, those
who are farthest off lose.</p>

<p>This game used formerly to be played by
the ladies of the Court, but now-a-days it is
only played by children in the streets.</p>

CARD GAMES</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-o.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Our card games are more complicated
than those played in Europe.
One of the reasons of this is the
number of cards in the Chinese pack, which
contains 120, subdivided into four classes,
corresponding with four colours, and into
thirty species. There are thus only four
cards of each species, and thirty of each
class.</p>

<p>The pack includes nine cords; the first
cord, the second cord, and so on, up to the
ninth cord; nine cakes; nine faces; a red
man; a civilian; and a butterfly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Different kinds of games can, of course,
be played with the same kind of cards.</p>

<h3>FIRST CARD GAME—AWAITING THE CARD</h3>

<p>Five players take their places at the table;
the cards are shuffled, and are cut into eight
packs of fifteen each. Three dice are cast,
and three of the packs are removed in the
order designated by the numbers on the
dice. A third cast of the dice determines
who is to take the first of the five remaining
packs. The player on the right takes the
second, and so on. The three packs that
were removed are placed in a box, and the
bottom card of all is turned round and given
to the happy possessor of the first pack.
Each takes his cards, and arranges them
according to the kind and value of the
cards, thus: first cord, second cord, third
cord, and so on; or, first man, second man,
third man; or, first cake, second cake, third
cake; or, second cord, second man, second
cake. To win, a player must have one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
more sets. There are seven sets, composed
as follows:—</p>

<p>III.—Eighth cake, second cord, second man.</p>

<p>II.—Ninth man, eighth cord, butterfly.</p>

<p>V.—Ninth cord, the civilian, ninth man.</p>

<p>IV.—Ninth cord, the civilian, the red man.</p>

<p>VI.—Seventh cake, third cord, third man.</p>

<p>VII.—Ninth cake, first cord, first man.</p>

<p>I.—First, second, and third cakes.</p>

<p>The cards must be arranged in sets, as
soon as they have been picked up off the
table. If a player has only two cards of one
set, he must hand an isolated card to the
player on his right, who takes it, if it is of
any service to him, and, in his turn, hands
one of the cards in his hand to his neighbour
on the right. If, on the other hand, he has
no use for it, he rejects it, and takes the
bottom card off the pack in the box. This
he keeps and hands another card to the
player on his right, and so on.</p>

<p>When one of the players has managed to
get together all the seven sets, with the
exception of one set, which lacks only one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
card to complete it, he lays down on the
table the leading card of one of the sets, and
this gives him the right to take all the cards
which are taken out of the box to complete
his sets. If he succeeds in doing so, he
wins.</p>

<p>The number of sets held by the winner
are then counted, and he is paid, according
to the amount fixed upon at the start, so
much for each set.</p>

<p>Sometimes, also, it is the first card at the
top of the pack placed in the box that is
turned round. This card is called gold, and
every player, who has a similar card in his
hand, may use it instead of any other card
that may be wanting to complete any set in
his hand.</p>

<h3>SECOND GAME—FISHING</h3>

<p>This game is played by three players.</p>

<p>The cards are divided into eight packs
of fourteen cards each, and eight cards remain
over. The dice indicate which three
packs are to be placed in the box. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
packs are chosen at haphazard, and are
added to the eight cards that remained
over.</p>

<p>A second cast of the dice determines the
distribution of the three remaining packs,
which each player is to take.</p>

<p>The player who takes the last of these
three packs must spread out on the table,
face upwards, and according to their values,
all the cards in the pack which is composed
of the two selected packs, together with
the eight cards that remained over, so that
all the players can see what they are, just
as is the case with the dummy at whist.</p>

<p>In reward for his trouble, the rule of
the game awards him a privilege. He receives,
at once, the top card in the box,
which otherwise he would only have had
later on, and so he knows at once what
card to expect.</p>

<p>The first to play takes one of the cards
in his hand to fish for one of the cards,
which he hopes will be the same number
(it is not necessary that it should have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
same picture) on the table with it. He
then draws another card from the bottom
of the pack in the box. Each of the other
players does the same in turn. If the dummy
is dead, that is to say, if none of its cards
is of the number you want, you do not fish,
but you throw out a card—or hook—without
taking anything.</p>

<p>When all the cards have been drawn,
each player counts his sets he is able to
make up out of the cards he has fished.
These sets are the same as in the preceding
game, with the exception of number V.
and number VI., which do not exist in this
game. Each card in set number I. counts
as thirteen points; in set number II., for
twelve points; in set number III., for eleven
points; in set number IV., for thirteen points;
and in set number VII., for ten points. Outside
the sets each card is worth only the
same number of points as its numerical value.
The first card is worth one, the second two,
and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<h3>THIRD GAME—THE PECKING GAME</h3>

<p>The same cards are used, and two persons
play. The cards are all placed together on
the table, and each player takes three cards,
of which he turns one up, so as to see which
is to begin pecking. The first player throws
one card on the table and the other does
the same. If the player whose turn it is to
throw sees that with the cards in his hand
and those on the table he can make up a
set he picks them up, and so the game goes
on; the cards being taken three by three
from the pack until all have been drawn.
When that is done, the number of points
held by each player, according to the system
of counting described above, is counted.</p>

<p>In all these games, besides the stake,
each player may place a sum of money or
a single coin before him on the table. If
he loses, he loses this money also; whilst
if he wins, each player has to pay him an
equivalent sum. This is betting added to
staking. We have also cards representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
chess figures, in which the cannon, the
carriage, and the horse form a set, as do
also three similar cards, or the general, the
councillor, and the elephant.</p>

<p>These cards are played in the same way
as the others. Chinese cards are always
much smaller than those used in Europe,
measuring about one inch by two. These
cards were invented under the reign of
the Han dynasty, as a pastime and as a
relief in solitude. But now-a-days they have
become a social game, even in parties
where people are far from wanting subjects
of amusement.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>LOTTERIES</i></span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">We have no official lottery, and,
unless I am greatly mistaken, we
never did have one. The private
lottery, however, which is generally very
advantageous to its promoters, does exist
in China. When a person is in want of
money, be it to pay for the funeral of
a relation, or for the expenses connected
with a marriage in his family, or to help
one of his relations to go to Pekin for the
examinations, he gets forty or fifty friends
and acquaintances of his together, and begs
them to take tickets in his lottery. These
tickets cost so much, payable in fractions
at each of the drawings. The first prize-winner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
is, of course, the organiser of the
lottery, and the amount at stake for the
first drawing becomes his without any drawing
being necessary to determine his right.
That is in reality only an advance or loan
to be repaid by instalments, for at all the
subsequent drawings he pays just like his
friends, and cannot win a second prize.
The second and subsequent drawings determine
the prize-winners, according to the
number of points obtained by each player
with the dice-box. Six dice are used. At
each of these parties, which take place once
a quarter or once every six months, the
prize-winner always gives a dinner to the
others. Everything is done so straightforwardly
that in the end nobody loses,
as each player can only win once. Nobody
may play until he has paid the amount due
on his ticket. The highest throw takes the
whole stake, without deduction either for
commission or interest, a small amount being
retained for the dinner alone. In China we
do not invest our money as is done everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
else, and accordingly the last winner
has no reason to regret that his turn to win
only came at the end. On the contrary,
this investment of small sums paid away
from time to time, resulting in the acquisition
of a lump sum at the end, is a very good
saving operation. It helps to buy a piece
of land, and at the same time he has the
satisfaction of knowing that he has helped
a friend in need. The use of these lotteries
is very general amongst the middle classes,
that is to say, amongst very honourable
and very solvable people, who don’t like
to place themselves under obligations by
asking for other kinds of loans, and are
too proud to accept alms. Being in want
of money they make use of this system
of borrowing, with the obligation of repaying
the sum received in a certain number
of annuities. In the upper classes money
is never needed, whilst amongst the lower
classes the lottery system cannot be employed,
because there is no guarantee of the
solvability of the organiser. Amongst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
latter class, however, there is another kind
of mutual help which renders the greatest
services to the less fortunate members of
Chinese society. Supposing that a workman
has lost his father, his colleagues immediately
subscribe enough to pay the
funeral expenses. Or supposing that he
wants to get married, arrangements are made
to supply him at once with the funds he
may require. Supposing his son passes his
examinations, instead of sending him presents
in kind, his friends send him money,
so that he may have the means of paying
his expenses connected with the celebration
of his success. Thus we have no public
charity funds. These are replaced by a
friendly and solid understanding between
people of the same class and position of
society, who know each other’s means, and
understand how to help each other. Such
mutual services are never refused. A respectable
man can always count on the help
of his friends under the circumstances mentioned.
And this simple organisation forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
each man to be kind and helpful towards his
neighbour, for nobody is sure of to-morrow.
One does as one would be done by. Thus
when one of these associates in benevolence
happens to die, his widow and children continue
to profit by it, and receive together with
the inheritance of the deceased the tokens
of gratitude from those he has helped, and
which, had he lived, he would have enjoyed
in due time. We have in this system a kind
of pension and life insurance fund. Our
system, however, forces every one—and just
because he has no special right to anything—to
be good and kind towards all his neighbours.
Besides these regular and useful lottery organisations,
there are others which are irregular
and mischievous. These are mere forms of
gambling pure and simple. I wish to speak,
in the first place, of the game of Thirty-six
Beasts, about which there has been so much
talk of late—perhaps more so in Paris than in
Camboja. This Cambojan roulette has been
described over and over again, and is, it may
be mentioned, an importation of Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
origin. We do not play this game with
figures as our neighbours do, but with
counters, on which the names of the animals
are written. A group of individuals announce
that they are going to open a bank, and this
without formality of any sort. The news
is discreetly and rapidly hawked about the
town by the help of numerous agents. Every
morning the bankers hoist up on to a high
pole a bag, into which one of the thirty
counters has been placed at haphazard. The
public stake their money on any one of the
thirty-six beasts, and those who have backed
the beast whose name is inscribed on the
counter in that bag that day, win thirty times
what they have staked. The six last names
are exclusively reserved to the bank. Needless
to say, that the players almost always lose.
Superstition, which always goes with gambling
games, is not wanting here either. To
guess the right name, players will put the
list before their gods, or before Buddha, and
beg him to give a sign by which they may
know which beast is the winning one. Ashes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
of incense falling on one of the names in the
list, or the burning caused by a spark from
one of the altar candles, are considered
sure straight-tips to the gamblers, who, no
matter under what sky they live, are always
far more simple than intelligent.</p>

<p>As may be seen from this rapid analysis,
the game of the thirty-six beasts is a kind of
roulette, in which the names of animals are
used instead of numbers. It is forbidden by
law. Doubtless it is only another kind of
lottery, but the daily drawings are too ruinous
for those who are carried away by their
passion for gambling. This is the reason
why, in the Middle Empire, this dangerous
game is forbidden. It is never let out to
authorised speculators, and is always carried
on in a clandestine manner, and is invariably
very short-lived. If the organisers fall into
the clutches of the law, they are very severely
punished. Several years’ imprisonment is
not considered too severe a punishment for
these harpies on the purses of the poor. On
the other hand, the mutual help lottery is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
considered by all as a useful and respectable
undertaking, so much so, that, should it be
found impossible to get a sufficient number
of people to put their money into one of these
speculations, the public officials may be
applied to, and are always found ready to
contribute their mites to an undertaking
which is purely of self-help, and which has
often relieved those miseries to which, alas!
our poor human race is exposed in every
clime and at every age.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>PUBLIC PLEASURES</i><br />
THE THEATRES</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The theatre in China is always a
private institution. We have no
State-supported theatres, but, on
the other hand, many rich people have
theatres in their houses. In the north of
China the public has its theatres the same
as in Europe, where regular performances of
fashionable pieces are given, and where
people may dine in the boxes or on the
balcony. Everywhere else there is nothing
to be had in the way of theatrical representations,
except from troupes of strolling actors,
who play in the temples, restaurants, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
private houses. A set stage is to be seen
in every temple, and performances are given
on it on the feast day of the patron god of
the temple, or for the accomplishment of
certain vows. In both cases a troupe is sent
for and a piece is selected. Whilst the
organisers are taking their seats in the side
balconies, which are our equivalent for your
stage-boxes, the public is admitted gratuitously,
and may place itself either in front or
around the stage. At the end of each act—as
a rule, only one-act pieces are played—an
actor, disguised as a woman, offers the
organisers of the fête a certain number of
sticks to choose from. On each stick is
written the name of one of the plays in the
repertory of the troupe. A performance
always includes five acts, or, as is usually
the case, and generally means the same
thing, five pieces, which have to be played
through in the course of the evening. On
the Emperor’s or Empress’s birthday similar
performances are given before the houses of
all the public officials, and take place accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
in the street. This is a treat for the
people, who may attend without paying.
There are stages in our big restaurants, and
performances are given there twice or three
times every week. The public seat themselves
in parties of four or of six at tables,
which are arranged in parallel rows to the
stage, and in such a way that nobody has
his back turned to the stage. As the
customers of these restaurants are all rich
people, the actors often get down off the
stage to serve wine round, and to ask what
piece they shall play. Should the piece thus
chosen be found a success and well played,
the person who chose it rewards the actors
with cash. The actor takes the notes and
places them on a tray, which he shows to
the public in proof of the generosity of the
giver. Should the piece be badly played, or
any portion of it be badly sung, the public
remains absolutely silent, without manifesting
feeling of any kind. The practice of hissing
is never indulged in in Chinese theatres.
The silence of the public is the rebuke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
administered to the actors. If, on the other
hand, the piece has been creditably performed,
there is only one voice among the
public to applaud. All the spectators rise
to their feet as of one common accord, and
shout “Lao, Lao.” This shows that in
China we are both polite in our disapproval
and prompt to enthusiasm when we are
pleased. This national trait is the key to
the conduct of the majority of the Chinese
under all circumstances. They never criticise
directly; they never noisily disapprove
of anything, nor give vent to cries of anger:
silence suffices for them; silence, which in
itself alone has the eloquence of the severest
comments, the most indignant exclamations,
and is withal dignified; silence, which condemns
without discussion and without appeal.
A peculiarity of our theatres which may be
noted here, is that the orchestra, instead of
being placed in front of the stage, is always
behind it, and plays no matter what piece of
music, and always without notes. The conductor
wields no baton, but has a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
tambourine in one hand and a pair of castanets
in the other. The first indicates the
time, the others changes in the tone. The
actors always play by heart without the help
of a prompter. We should laugh were we
to see a musician using notes, or a gentleman
hidden away in a kind of kennel whispering
words to an actor at the moment perhaps
when he is in the finest frenzy of passion.
In front of the stage, on the two pillars
which face the public, there may be generally
seen amongst other decorations two bills
inscribed with philosophical reflections.</p>

<p>The following is one of the best known:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You may consider this performance as true or
as false. It is always an image of life and
of its conclusions.”</p>

</div>

<p>Besides our big theatres we have also
puppet shows, in which the puppets are tied
to strings and worked by people hidden in
the flies. Punch and Judy, worked by the
fingers of an actor concealed behind a curtain,
are very popular in China. These miniature
theatres are much in favour with the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
of places which cannot support a real theatre.
The performances are exactly the same as
on the large stages, and are always accompanied
with music and songs from behind
the stage. The only difference is that the
actors are in cardboard instead of being of
flesh and blood, and are very small instead
of being very big, a matter of little consequence
after all. The size, the costumes,
and the substance of the actors may be overlooked,
for all that is merely superficial and
a deceit of the eye. The truth—the great
and immortal truth—is that our desires and
our passions, our joys and our woes, are
always the same, and never, never change.
In every clime and in every age do we see
the eternal human comedy repeat itself.</p>

<h3>I.—CRICKET FIGHTS</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-c.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">China never knew those horrible
arena fights which were the passing
pleasures, and will be the eternal
shame, of ancient Rome. We never gave
for the amusement of our refined folk the
sight of bloody fights between men and
wild animals, “the whilom joy of the young
vestal virgin.” So it will be useless to look
in China for any statue of a dying gladiator,
or to search the ruins of the Colosseum.
Nor has the bull-fight—last vestige of the
tragic Circenses of long ago—ever been seen
in China. We do, however, have animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
fights, but it will be seen that there is nothing
very terrible about them.</p>

<p>To begin with, we set crickets to fight
against each other. Yes, crickets. The
modest denizens of the grass are terrible
fighters, good company as they also are.
Their fights, though wanting in <i lang="fr">mise en scène</i>,
are none the less interesting, and the people
crowd to witness them. The crickets, once
collected for the purpose in the fields, are
very carefully trained, each prisoner being
lodged in a little bamboo cage. Its food
consists of grains of rice, to which a few
leaves of salad are added. After having
been trained in this way for some days, the
captive is set at liberty temporarily, that is
to say, and in a very relative manner. The
object of his release, as a matter of fact, is
only to give him the opportunity of trying
his strength against some veteran of the
cricket-ring.</p>

<p>The two combatants are placed in a bowl,
which is generally made of wood, so as
to prevent them from slipping about too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
much. The trainer tickles their heads with
a hair, to work them up to a sufficient
degree of hatred and bad feeling. When
this point has been reached, they dash
violently against each other, and the first
shock upsets one of the combatants, and
decides the victory. The vanquished withdraws,
ashamed and resigned. The victor,
intoxicated with delight, claps his hands,
and celebrates his triumph with piercing
cries.</p>

<p>As soon as the fighting powers of the different
insects have been tested by successive
rehearsals, the more robust are picked out, and
on these devolves the honour of appearing
as champions in the public arena. Bets will
be made on each of them with as much
interest and passion as in Europe are made
about horses. I hasten to add that these
bets never exceed a few pence in value.
The bettors are thus able to indulge themselves
in their favourite pastime more frequently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.—QUAIL FIGHTS</h3>

<p>We have just witnessed a very bloodless
tournament. There are others of a more
serious nature, and in which the combatants
get rather more hurt. I speak of our quail-fights.
Please do not think that I am about
to describe such sanguinary spectacles as are
afforded, for instance, to the English in their
cock-fight. The quails fight, but only with
the weapons with which Nature has provided
them. They have no artificial spurs, and
none of those perfections which add to the
natural ferocity of the kings of the poultry-yard.
The birds are trained for a few days,
until their owner thinks them sufficiently prepared
for the fray. The hour of battle has
sounded. The quails, placed face to face,
are excited by their masters. At last they
dash at each other, each trying to seize his
adversary while protecting himself against
the other’s blows. They chase each other,
pursue, follow, run, jump, dodge, return, and
escape again. At last they seize each other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
feathers begin to fly, a body to body fight
begins, until, at last, one of the combatants
is obliged to own himself defeated, and
hastens to escape, with drooping wings, from
the beak of his cruel vanquisher.</p>

<p>There is little cruelty in all this—it is
rather a struggle than a fight. The combatants
rarely hurt each other much, and if
there is victor and vanquished, it may at
least be said, as was said in the French
comedy, “We know how to kill each other,
and neither will die.”</p>

THE PLEASURES OF A PHILOSOPHER</span></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">There are perhaps in China alone
more philosophers than could be
found in all the rest of the world
put together. To give an idea of the ways
of thinking of these thinkers, who take their
pleasure where they can find it, I will let one
of them speak:</p>

<p>“The song of birds and the cries of the
swallows announce the advent of spring;
the fine weather invites one to walk abroad.
I should have liked to respond to this call
from Nature; my daily occupations have
prevented me. I met yesterday at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
flower cottage a friend who blamed me for
having failed to keep an appointment. I
answered: ‘Ah, I am not free as you are
to do what I choose. I live dependent
on another, to whom I am subjected as a
minor is to his guardian. Ah! if you could
only know how many writing brushes and
how much paper I use in the course of one
year. In the face of this beautiful weather,
where Nature is developing with renewed
vigour, I can only envy the pleasures of others
without being able to share in them myself.
But in compensation I find pleasure in passing
my days of leisure in the bosom of my
family, surrounded by those I love.</p>

<p>“‘When seated by my fireside, I drink
wine with my wife, and hold my children
on my knees; I feel no other human ambition,
and do not believe that the spirits in heaven
are a whit happier than I am. Sometimes,
as a change, we go and drink a cup of tea
in the cottage, or look at the flowers in the
garden. We are thus surrounded at home
with joys which endure and do not change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘As regards what you call pleasure, it is
only the result of a combination of circumstances,
and may any day change and completely
disappear. Good dinners, excellent
wines, horses, games—all those things are
but instantaneous metamorphoses, where no
solid basis ensuring their eternal duration
exists. That resembles a beautiful orange
which might contain nothing but a spongy
and savourless tissue. After the fireworks
have died out, night rules again, and the
darkness appears only all the darker.</p>

<p>“‘Have you read the story of X——, who
played the heavy swell, and threw money
out of the window by handfuls. His friends
besieged his house without interruption. His
servants were prouder than the noblest lords.
Night and day the only thought was what
pleasure-party should be arranged for the
following day. One might have imagined
that his house was built over a gold mine,
to see the life he led.</p>

<p>“‘But at the end of a certain number of
years his resources began to fail. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
could not, however, change his way of
living.</p>

<p>“‘He first of all resorted to loans from his
generous friends, and next went to the pawn-shop.
When all their resources had been
exhausted he ran away.</p>

<p>“‘Oh! my friend, the number of rich dishes
eaten by that man with an air of complete
satisfaction. Oh! my friend, the number of
beautiful women who were proud to be styled
his friends even for a day. His name was
known everywhere, in the theatres, in society,
and everywhere where fashionable people
meet together. Oh! the many fashions that
he invented merely in colours and hues of
silk. And the jewels that he distributed
right and left.</p>

<p>“‘All that was done with the money of other
people, since his bills have not yet been paid.
Is that pleasure? Come, you will admit that
it is not.</p>

<p>“‘Instead of gleaming for a short while and
being eternally disgraced thereafter, I prefer
during my moments of leisure to light my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
incense-burner on my little table, and to sit
at it chatting with our sages through my
books. It is there that solid pleasures are
to be found, far preferable to those which
are only superficial. All that can be felt
and seen has already been described, and
costs nothing to read about. Songs, music,
beautiful women, I see them and hear them
in these admirable pages. Why, then, go
running again through the grey dust to
those places where your personality is effaced,
and money alone reigns in uncontested
mastery?’”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
